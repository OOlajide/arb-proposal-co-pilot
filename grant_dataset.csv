The closest thing is Forgotten Runes. We are building a 2 player PvP digital miniature turn-based strategy game called Machinata. The base version of the game includes 27 cards consisting of units, buildings and spells. Each card summons a miniature, creates a building, or casts a spell. Both players take turns summoning units, creating buildings and casting spells with the goal of destroying the other player’s base. \n\nLike Warhammer 40K, the game has collectable digital miniatures at its core. It is a concept that we believe fits perfectly in Web3 due to several factors highlighted in the sections below. \n\nHow we plan to utilize Arbitrum: Our game and NFT collection will be launching on Arbitrum. Machinata is seeking to create a Web3 Warhammer40K digital miniature experience, bringing gamers, collectors, artists into the fold while also leading to additional on-chain transactions and fees for the network. \n\nWe are huge believers in the ETH ecosystem, and Arbitrum specifically. We’ve been involved in TreasureDAO since its inception and released our open-source game, Ruffion Reborn, the first homebrew cartridge for Treasure. \n\nHow your project fits within this week's theme: ITD Machinata is designed as a play-to-earn game, allowing players to earn from their in-game actions. Players will be receiving NFTs for their participation in the game while also being able to purchase NFTs and receive a free version of the game. We will also be enabling a community of creators – artists can create their own variants of units and sell limited edition miniatures via the Machinata marketplace.  \n\nHow you plan to use the 2,500 ARB if selected as a grantee: \n\nThe 2,500 ARB will allow us to get closer to our next upcoming milestone to have our first milestone. Our next upcoming milestone is to complete a single player build with subset of 27 card deck. We are first creating a subset of the game with 9-12 cards, a single player experience with an AI opponent.",Arbitrum Minigrants

Our goal is to bridge the gap between Web2 and Web3 by creating a blockchain game that engages and educates people from all backgrounds. We believe that by providing an interactive and relatable gamified experience, we can make the learning process less tedious and more enjoyable. This will increase the adoption rate of the blockchain ecosystem in Africa and globally.\n\nHOW OUR PROJECT IS UTILIZING IS UTILIZING ARBITRUM\n\nOur products currently ranges in various IRL tabletop game form which we have also used to educate, impact and on boarded folks and builders into the arbitrum ecosystem through the customised arbitrum game boxes we have made and distributed to community members, schools and future generation of blockchain users. Also, we organise an annual gaming festival for both Web2&3 folks tagged, 'THE WEB2&3 GAME HANGOUT '.\n\nHOW OUR PROJECT FITS INTO THE THEME\n\nOur project which is also community driven, is helping drive the onboarding of not only the web3 players but the web2 markets too into the Arbitrum ecosystem through our tabletop card games. The Play2Learn games are not only serving entertainment to its community but includes learning and marketing of such ecosystem indirectly. Simplifying the learning of blockchain at its finest through tabletop games for the ecosystem.\n\nAMOUNT RAISED\n\nWe have received zero funding from VCs and the only grant we have received was from the Plurality Labs, Milestone 1, through the Arbitrum DAO which was a total sum of $300. Asides that, we have been bootstrapping since inception.\n\nHOW WE INTEND USING THE 2,500 ARBITRUM\n\nPRODUCTION MACHINE - $3,000\n\nThe purchase of the equipment will help fasten production for our startup and help reduce costs incurred as a result of outsourcing of the job.\n\nARBITRUM SPECIAL GAMING MATERIALS - $1,500\n\nHere, the material and man power needed to manufacture the Arbitrum customised games which ranges in different form and shapes will be gotten and made into finished products for the distribution of the community here in Nigeria and Africa as a whole.\n\nLOGISTICS & DISTRIBUTION - $500\n\nThese Custom made Arbitrum games designed, will be distributed to the Web3 enthusiasts, Web2 folks and several colleges and high schools, which have partnered with us to bring them the goodnews of blockchain technology.",Arbitrum Minigrants

The goal of this event is threefold: 1) to convene builders at the forefront of the consumer crypto space in an emerging geographic market where the benefits of crypto are desperately needed; 2) to expose local Bahamians to the newer aspects of the industry; 3) to help repair the damage that the local crypto ecosystem suffered as a result of the FTX collapse\n\nhow your project is utilizing arbitrum - At Oasis we hope to activate an onchain Arbitrum gaming hub, in partnership with BLVKHVND (esports dao), with hopes to integrate gaming culture into the consumer crypto conversation and to evolve the landscape of indie gaming. This would bring new users into current Arbitrum-based games and help users get familiar and excited about the Arbitrum ecosystem. After the event, we would set up an Arbitrum gaming hackathon for the local dev & gaming/esports community, to continue bringing new builders into the Arbitrum ecosystem to build fresh new gaming prototypes or architecture that can support existing gaming experiences.\n\nhow your project fits within this week's theme - Oasis Onchain, at its core, is focused on empowering (and activating) web3 communities. We see consumer crypto as an incredible rocket pad to bring new people into the space, and focusing on potential new users in the Caribbean (where financial access is low and proper access to crypto rails are legitimately life-altering), will have vast long-term impact. In addition, connecting current consumer crypto builders with local attendees will allow those builders to experiment with product market fit in an entirely new (and eager) market.\n\nroughly how much you've already received in VC funding and/or grants (please specify whether money raised was from VC rounds or grants) - no current grant funding or VC funding\n\nhow you plan to use the 2,500 ARB if selected as a grantee - Would use it mainly to activate participation in the aforementioned local arbitrum gaming hackathon",Arbitrum Minigrants

We also seek to assign the phone number to the wallet so that users can transfer using only the whatsapp number of the recipient, vice versa.\n\nIn which stage is the project currently at?\nWe have worked on an idea conceptualization MVP, which includes:\nWe have developed a Smart Contract that simulates the Account Abstraction layer. \nWe have developed the backend project that exposes the communication API's between the WhatsApp service and the Smart Contracts. \nThe original idea has been presented at the Eth Global Online hackathon, where we passed the first round of live interviews with the judges. \n\nWhere are you heading with this grant?\nWe seek to generate an Open Source solution for the benefit of the community and we will seek to mature the solution to support the main use cases that we face as web3 builders. \nWe seek to develop it and turn it into a product that solves the usability problems that the ecosystem currently has. We will launch the first version of the product in the particular WhatsApp use case. Being the first WhatsApp wallet to use Account Abstraction.\n\nWhat are your metrics of success?\nThe first success metric is the product completion rate, which we will measure every sprint and is directly related to the development of the authentication and core modules of the project. The completion of the product development includes the first use case through WhatsApp. Thus we have:\nCustom-auth module complete.\nCore module complete.\nPublished documentation (English and Spanish).\nProduction use case: WhatsApp Wallet using custom-auth and core modules in production.\nThe second success metric is adoption, which we will measure based on the number of forks in the main repository, the number of pull request generators and the activity using our use case.

I've created custom datasets with all the possible commands used for variety of transactions.\n\ne.g: Swapping can be represented by:\nI want to swap 10 USDC for DAI\nGive me the best price of USDT for 10 DAI\nExchange 20 DAI for USDC\nI want to trade 15 USDC for USDT at the best market price\n\nSimilarly, we've taken into consideration, all the major variations that can be used, and trained a custom bayesian + ner based model, that can build out transaction objects within seconds.\n\nThe api is very modular i.e the transaction objects generated by the api can be signed via AA wallets, regular EOA's, multisig SAFE's and MPC's as well.\n\nWhere am I heading with this grant?\nI've incorporated a C-corp in Delaware as Bytekode Labs, Inc. Post completion of the grant, I'm planning to partner up with Dapps and other wallets in the space across various evm chains, and raise venture capital to hire and scale Bytekode.\n\nHere are some ways in which I think Bytekode can scale up:\n\na) Ecosystem + Infra Partnerships: Intents in the current scenario are very vaguely defined, and every company seems to have their own implementation + terminology. With Bytekode simplifying that process for all dapps (current ones, and the ones that are yet to be built), having strong integrations across dapps, will not only benefit users, but also contribute to Bytekode's growth\n\nb) Institutions and Crypto Hedge Funds: These institutions have a really large influx of capital, and doing the right trade and the precise second could potentially save millions. Working with these funds, on a contractual basis, will result in profitability and growth\n\nc) Social Subscriptions: Brands using NFT's for engagement, can definitely up their game by enabling gasless mints that are powered social commands (discord /telegram bots). Enabling infra for these, is another avenue for growth\n\nThese are the relevant metrics I'll be measuring for success:\n\na) Product & Development:\nExtending Bytekode for the Arbitrum Ecosystem.\n\nEST Development Time: 2-3 weeks\n- Building a custom indexer that constantly fetches latest transactions in a block, maps it to their transaction objects, and builds out subsequent commands for the same. Resulting in a sort of a perpetually learning ml model.\n\nEST Development Time: 2-3 weeks\n- Enabling multistatement intents.\nfor eg: Swap 10 USDC for DAI, and deposit that into my AAve pool\nThe goal is to successfully categorize these, and build out an array of transaction objects for the same. Swapping requires approval, and then the token swap. Depositing into aave requires approval and then the deposit. So our goal is to train the ml model to catch all these instances, with a near perfect accuracy\n\nEST Development Time: 3-4 weeks\n- Adding support for swapping, lending, borrowing and nft trading. This means, using off-chain storage for ABI's and deployed addresses for the above contracts, using our ml model to classify commands into these categories, and using our transaction builder to compute transaction objects for the same.\n\nEST: Development time: 1-2 weeks\n- Building an off-chain ens resolver, for an even faster experience in cases of native/erc20/nft transfers.\n\nb) Adoption & Growth:\n\n- API usage (varied by Chain/protocol/wallet)\n- Num. product partnerships\n- Inbounds from Potentical VC's/Angel Investors\n- Since, I'll be integrating with various protocols across different chains, onboarding them as ecosystem partners would be really beneficial to Bytekode\n\nABOUT THE TEAM\n\nShlok Mange\n- Part of the prestigious Polygon India Fellowship (Top 50/ 10K + applicants)\n- Developed Infra for various products including Mercedes Blockchain Day, Adidas x Prada NFT , Coinbase India NFT Launch while at Dehidden\n- Won 7 + national and international hackathons.

(Extra points if you have already started developing the project)\nEspacio Cripto was started by me, Abraham Cobos and Lalo Rios. Lalo and I met at a crypto conference in 2018; we started being friends on that day and kept in touch for the upcoming years. In August 2020, Lalo and I reconnected and started ideating around starting a new podcast; that's when we began Espacio Cripto's community. This project was born to create high-value crypto content in Spanish; we want to help people understand crypto most impartially and positively. Here are some of our achievements as a community:\n1. Our North Star: Espacio Cripto's community grew significantly during the last months. We went from having 556 to 1,669 community members in Telegram 1 in the previous year, a growth of 295%. This is an active group with an engagement of more than 25% (readers and writers).\n2. We went from having 51 episodes to 225 as of November 3, 2023. We produced more than 250 hours of educational content.\n3. We've got more than 115,000 downloads in the last year.\n4. According to our 2022 Spotify wrap, we were in the top 10 podcasts for +23,000 people, top 5 for 17,000 people, and top 1 for almost 6,000 people. We're really proud of that impact.\n5. According to Spotify, we were the top technology podcast in Mexico for 198 days in 2022\n6. Our channels significantly impact the LATAM community and have grown a lot in the last year.\n- Instagram followers: from 1,889 to 5,587, a growth of 296% \n- Twitter followers: from 2,749 to 6,767, a growth of 246% \n- Newsletter: from 489 to 1,180, a growth of 241%\n7. We have executed a monthly community meetup since February 2022.\n8. We execute virtual educational sessions at least each month.\n9. We gave a scholarship to 9 community members to assist Devcon. The Ethereum Foundation helped us with the tickets, and we provided accommodation for the community.\n\nWe've helped several people in LATAM to explore crypto and deep dive into the industry. We want to recognize one of our most important contributors, AnaTech. Ana joined Espacio Cripto as the first full-time team member, and her attitude to learning and natural community nurturing made her grow quickly. Today, Ana is a Community Manager at the Arbitrum Foundation, and our whole community is really proud of her. Here, you can read her story\n\nWeb3 name: AnaTech\n\nHow did I join Espacio Cripto, and how was my web3 knowledge back then? Espacio Cripto was the first web3 community I've been part of and was the beginning of everything. Back then, I knew about Bitcoin and Ethereum but only the basic things. Before joining, everything was hard to understand, especially because finding reliable resources was challenging. Espacio Cripto is a vibrant and friendly community; whenever I had a question, someone was there to help me. Through Espacio Cripto, I met many cool and inspiring people.\nHow do I contribute to web3 today, and how has Espacio Cripto helped me get here? I'm part of the Arbitrum Foundation, helping with community development to help scale Ethereum. Espacio Cripto was my starting point, where I found many friends and opportunities. Lalo and Abraham, the founders of Espacio Cripto, one of the most listened-to podcasts in Spanish about crypto in LATAM and the largest web3 community in Mexico, gave me the opportunity to create educational content in Spanish about Web3 and boost the community. At Espacio Cripto, I continued to share, learn, and gain new abilities and friends. I saw and helped many newcomers safely join the space and many new builders finding their path in the Web3 ecosystem over one and a half years.\nWhere are you heading with this grant? (Are you looking to turn this into a company or leave it open-source? / are there any plans to continue building this project after a successful grant completion?)\nWe will continue building Espacio Cripto for a long time. We have the reputation, engagement, and trust of our community, and we live up to a top-quality standard to ensure we're helping people get more involved in this industry. This reputation has helped us obtain the trust of organizations like The Ethereum Foundation, Optimism, Fuel, and many more.\n\nWhat are your metrics of success?

At its core, it offers an opportunity to reconstruct and redefine the financial landscape of the continent. Through DeFi, we envision a future where every African has unrestricted access to vital financial services, including borrowing, lending, trading, and investing—services that have often been inaccessible or prohibitively expensive within the traditional financial framework.\n\nYet, DeFi transcends mere finance. It empowers Africans to actively participate in the burgeoning global economy, ensuring that our voice resonates and our innovations are acknowledged on the world stage. It can act as a remedy to longstanding issues like poverty, corruption, and systemic disparities, paving the way for a more just and prosperous Africa.\n\nHowever, for this promise to materialize, there's an urgent need to address a glaring gap: Africa's representation in the Web3 space. Despite boasting a vast, young, and talented demographic, our presence in the Web3 arena remains sparse. This isn't just an oversight; it's a missed opportunity. Web3 isn't a luxury for Africa; it's a lifeline. It embodies a chance to design systems that are genuinely inclusive, ensuring that in the digital future, every African has a seat at the table.\n\nOur mission with this project is twofold: to amplify Africa's voice in the Web3 chorus and to unlock the latent potential within our shores. We're not merely seeking representation; we're striving for leadership. With the right tools, training, and platforms, we believe that Africa can not only catch up in the Web3 race but can also lead the change, showcasing our unique blend of innovation, resilience, and vision.","Questbook - Education, Community Growth and Events"

Born in May 2022, our goal is to spread knowledge, awareness and education around the Web3 & Blockchain ecosystem, involving builders who create and bring new value in the space. Our core activities include meetups, events, coworking days, traveling to hackathons & conferences and other educational activities. Our biggest community effort so far has been ETHRome (6-8th Oct 2023), the 1st Web3 hackathon in Italy, focused on Privacy & Governance topics.\n\n4. What type of audience are you targeting: beginners, intermediate, developers, general public, financial, academic, startups, etc.? \n\nOur target audience goes from beginners to expert web3 builders. We say builders and not developers as our community is really diverse (designers, lawyers, project managers, business developers, etc.), however around 70% of people are developers. In urbe.eth we can count on many people with years of experience in the space but also on the freshness of students or newbies in the ecosystem who need a place to share their passion, ideas, and doubts with other like-minded people.\nWhen we started, in Rome (and in Italy) there wasn’t any other community or meeting point for people working and building in Web3 in our country and we needed that on our own. One year and half later we are the largest community for web3 builders in Italy, now welcoming international people on our Discord server.\nThe focus of our community has always been on tech and startups, against the typical narrative that it’s still predominant in Italy around Bitcoin, speculation and financial gains. We want to give people a space to learn, connect and create new projects that might shape how our society works in the future, thanks to web3 and blockchain.\n\n5.

Any contribution made by any member to the Arbitrum ecosystem?\n\nFrancesco and Paolo deployed a web3 project on Arbitrum mainnet. The project is called Brian (\n), an AI assistant for web3 that lets you:\nmaking transactions by prompting in a non-custodial way such as “swap 10 usdc for eth on Uniswap on Arbitrum?”\ndeploying smart contracts by prompting such as “deploy an NFT called ARB”\nsearching for transactions such as “What is Uniswap v4 and how does it work?”\nSection 3: Idea Roadmap/Milestones\n📌 Remember that the proposal must be finalized before the first days of April 2024. This is due to the fact that the domain has a duration of 6 months.\n\n1. What is the idea/project for which you are applying for a grant?\n\nUrbe.eth has been growing much lately, especially thanks to ETHRome and its impact. We want to keep pushing hard and expand our community of developers sharing with them all the knowledge, skills, and experiences at our disposal. We want to give them all the tools they might need to start contributing to the Web3 ecosystem as developers and builders.\n\nThanks to our extensive network of connections within the academic realm and programming training schools, we aim to orchestrate a week of Arbitrum-themed events.\n\nThe goal is to bring developers closer to the web3 world and the Arbitrum ecosystem by bringing 50 developers to build a project on Arbitrum at the end of the week.\n\nTo achieve this, we have envisioned three key activities:\nHosting an ""Urbe Talks"" event centered around Arbitrum, where four experts delve deeply into a technical topic related to the L2s and Arbitrum ecosystem (e.g., how Arbitrum works, how Arbitrum is scaling Ethereum, etc…). This event will serve as an introduction to the topics of the activity.\nConduct a five-day boot camp intended for 50 computer science students and novice developers interested in Web3. \nThe focus will be on full-stack Web3 development starting from the basics to deploying a project with smart contract and frontend part. As already happened for the ETHRome preparation bootcamp, Matheus Pagani will support us by bringing his knowledge, skills and experience in Rome, being responsible for teaching at the bootcamp.\nOrganization of a small hackathon specifically for bootcamp participants, which will serve as a practical test of the concepts learned during the experience.\n50 developers divided into teams will be able to experiment with the knowledge learned\nAll these activities will be held in person, in Rome, and will bring students from zero to hero in Web3 development.\n\n2. Tell us your plan of implementation for your idea/project.\n\nTarget Audience\nOur target audience for this project is Computer Science students (who are keen to learn about blockchain), Web2 developers (who are curious about Web3), and beginner Web3 developers (who need some guidance in their journey).\nUrbe.eth has always paid great attention to this audience by doing activities within universities and coding schools locally.\nThe initiatives described in Section 1.9 (Presentation) validated the need for this kind of activity within our local community, and we consider it crucial for Urbe's mission to onboard new developers in the space and keep aggregating Web3 builders in Rome. We believe that the best way to get involved and start contributing is by having like-minded people around. The more, the better!\n\nExpected Metrics\nUrbe Talks: The target for this event is 60 people, and includes technical and non-technical profiles.f\nBootcamp: We expect 50 computer science students & devs to attend the bootcamp.\nHackathon: We expect at least 40 people from the bootcamp to take part in the hackathon, forming teams of 2-3 people each and ending up with around 10 new projects developed.\nModality\nAll the events part of the project’s plan will be held offline and in person in Rome, as we strongly believe in the power of IRL experiences.\nUrbeTalks will kickstart the week of the event with some introductory talks around the importance of L2s to scale Ethereum, with particular attention and details to Arbitrum. There will be 4 brief and short talks of 10 minutes each just to give the audience some context before starting with the hands-on activities at the bootcamp.\nThe bootcamp is designed as interactive and hands-on sessions, blending theoretical understanding with practical coding activities, as well as async tasks to complete autonomously. These sessions will take place in physical venues, crafted to offer an environment that's conducive to learning.\n\nThe curriculum will be implemented by Matheus Pagani, also getting inspiration from existing resources such\nand will cover an introduction to blockchain, smart contract development, solidity programming, ethers.js, dAapp development (with ScaffoldETH), and final teamwork tasks right before the hackathon starts, to facilitate team formations.\n\nFinally, participants will take part in the hackathon, organizing teams of 2-3 people. This final step will allow attendees to demonstrate the skills and knowledge they acquired in Web3 development. The projects will be developed under the guidance of our team and with the support of our community members and will be presented at the end of the weekend as well as in ETHRome 2024.\n\nThe program as a whole represents a complete experience that speeds up attendees' Web3 development skills from having a general understanding of blockchain to becoming proficient Web3 developers ready to contribute to the growth of the Web3 ecosystem.\n\nTentative Calendar:\n1st Week of February: \nWednesday - UrbeTalks \n2nd Week of February: \nMonday - Bootcamp Day 1 \nTuesday - Bootcamp Day 2 \nWednesday - Bootcamp Day 3 \nThursday - Bootcamp Day 4 \nFriday - Bootcamp Day 5\nSaturday - Hackathon Day 1 \nSunday - Hackathon Day 2\n\nAssociation with organizations like Universities, Institutions and Companies\nWe are already associated with:\nUniversity La Sapienza of Rome, where we already organized Web3 talks and hands-on workshops in the past in a Master’s Course in Computer Science & Engineering.\nL42 Coding School, where we already organized a 4 days bootcamp to get started with Web3 development right before ETHRome. Some of the students ended up winning some prizes at the hackathon.\nTalent Garden Innovation Hub, where we usually host our coworking days and monthly meetups. They are the largest innovation hub in Rome, full of young talents that are joining the activities that we are carrying out\n3.

How does your idea/project align with the Arbitrum ecosystem?\n\nArbitrum allows Ethereum to scale by bringing in millions of users and numerous applications.\nUrbe's mission is to aggregate web3 builders and make activities to form new ones. Specifically with the activity of this grant, we want to bring new developers (students and web3 newbie devs) into the Arbitrum ecosystem and teach them so that they can develop web3 apps and bring users to Arbitrum. Arbitrum will become the entry point for these students and newbie developers into web3.\n\n2. Why will this idea/project be a growth force for Arbitrum?\n\nWe want to help bring new developers into the Arbitrum ecosystem and make Arbitrum the first network used for POC, projects, R&D, or anything else by these people. Having students and web2 developers starting their web3 journey through Arbitrum gives a high chance that they are gonna keep building on it at least in the first phase of their career. Deploying contracts, sending transactions, and checking Arbiscan as a first step will always be their baseline knowledge about web3.\n\nWe want to develop these learning activities in Rome (Italy), a place that we know well and in which we are leaders. We want to bring Arbitrum inside universities and coding schools. In these places, it’s not common to have lessons and workshops around blockchain (at least in Italy), and if they have, it’s usually around blockchain basics, Bitcoin, a few lines of Solidity, and the classical supply chain use case. Bringing Arbitrum to universities is a chance to show how Ethereum can be (and is being) scaled today, showing an easy way to explore, learn, and build on top of it.\n\nWe believe local first is the best approach to make Arbitrum's ecosystem grow. We started urbe.eth 1 year and a half ago because we wanted to find other Italians interested in Web3. At our first meetup, we were 3. Now we are a community of 700 people sharing goals, mindsets, and ambitions. Many of our members now often travel across Europe and the world to participate in hackathons and events\nThrough the Arbitrum Aeternum program, we want to translate this success to Arbitrum's ecosystem, creating a thriving and vibrant community in the heart of Europe.\n\n3. How will your project contribute to the expected benefit of the based on the amount given?\n\nOur contribution is to introduce Arbitrum to new devs who are not familiar with it, to do learning activities within universities and coding schools, and to bring these developers to create their first project on Arbitrum at the end of the learning path.\nWe are requesting money to cover expenses and to kick off this learning activity that may have a deeper value than it seems i.e., to make Arbitrum the entry point for numerous young developers entering the web3 world.\nSpecifically, we are requesting $18.850 for an activity for 50 people.\nWithout considering Urbe costs and the intangible value of awareness for Arbitrum, the cost of acquiring a single developer is less than $400 for Arbitrum.\nRegarding intangible values, we can highlight some of them:\nBrand value: There will be a hackathon focused on Arbitrum. This holds significant value, not only for the people participating but also for positioning. The second (ever) international web3 hackathon in Italy will be focused on Arbitrum. That holds value as well.\nReach value: We will make ad-hoc communication of the event on our channel but also, we want to create the best event possible so that hackers will then talk to their friends.\nNetworking: Developers will get to know each other and collaborate, we want to facilitate long-term collaborations\nEcosystem value: Arbitrum projects will have a well-defined talent pool to target for hiring resources or services\n4. How should the Arbitrum community measure the success of this grant?\n\nMeasuring Success: The success of the grant can be measured through key indicators such as:\nNew Developer Onboarding: min. 50 new developers (students/web2 developers) who actively participate in the conference, bootcamp, and mini-hackathon\nProject Development: Assess the quality and quantity of projects developed during the mini-hackathon. Successful projects and innovative solutions would indicate a positive outcome.\nArbitrum awareness: Arbitrum awareness increased as the entry point for new developers in the web3 space\nDevelopment of Local Web3 Community in Italy: growth of local web3 community, urbe.eth, in Italy as a result of the activities. Measure the number of participants who express interest in forming or joining web3 communities within Italy, promoting regional collaboration and engagement in the web3 ecosystem. This additional metric reflects the grant's impact on pushing the development of communities at a local level.\nReport Details: At the end of the grant, we will deliver a comprehensive report that includes detailed information on all activities conducted. The report will feature a breakdown of the one-day Urbe Talks, a comprehensive account of the four-day boot camp, and a showcase of the projects developed during the mini-hackathon (using the Taikai platform). We commit to submitting the final report on or before March 30, 2024. This timeline allows for thorough documentation and analysis of the week-long activities, ensuring the report accurately reflects the impact and outcomes of the grant.\nContact Information: The Urbe Community is responsible for organizing and managing the grant and associated activities. For any inquiries regarding the grant or the final report, please use the contact information provided above in the “Section 2: Team” section.\n\n5. In the long term, how will you continue to contribute to the Arbitrum ecosystem?\n\nThis activity can be the kickoff to a series of even larger and more structured learning activities. Urbe.eth is increasingly working with Italian universities and coding schools and can be a relevant strategic partner for the educational aspect. Urbe.eth is growing steadily and we have great ambitions to do better and better.\nWe already onboarded many new developers and builders in the web3 ecosystem, moving them from joining a local meetup to taking part in bigger international events such as Devconnect Istanbul.\n\nThis grant is a great opportunity for us to keep up the momentum after ETHRome and involve more people in space, and not only that. We are very dedicated to supporting these new builders coming to Web3 along their journey, giving them all the resources and tools that they might need to learn, create a project, or find a job.\nFor this reason, our efforts for the program go beyond the program itself, as Urbe is a community of builders who are committed to helping and supporting students and developers who are entering the web3 through their expertise offering ongoing learning opportunities and support.","Questbook - Education, Community Growth and Events"

It is quite messy to explain, but the bottom line is it will be less than 1000. That is including giving small tips to a few people who's work doesnt quite cut it, but it gets us a more positive vibe and will pay off in the long run.\nThe gun will be chosen from two guns by two separate 'teams'. \nThe main team/individual for the weapon is the individual who's site & portfolio I submitted in dms, and thats where the majority of 2000 will go, it might even eat a bit into the mapping budget or my 1k.\nThe backup option is 'Akz' and I. This part costs nothing, I will just send Akz a small appreciation gift. However I am nowhere near as good at weapon m as I am at mapping, and that why we're the backup.\n\n\n                                                                           UPDATE: Answer to Flook's questions\n\n1: A video of the current state of Frags gameplay\n\nSure, here's a video. \nI can improve this into a perfect Arbinaut dm pk3. Obviously, polishing all textures. Swapping hazard theme (black and yellow stripes) to Arbitrum theme (blue and black stripes).\n* The game is stable at 60fps. The frames in the video are low because I recorded in a VM.\n\n2: What the possibility of shipping an early alpha of the game in a quicker timeframe for less grant funding might look like\n\nSure. We can leech everything the Xonotic community has done, I can make a shitty map compatible with the newest version in 3 days, and slap a web3 login.\nBut that would be a dreadful thing to do. Our servers would probably get attacked for that. And understandably so.\n\nThe only morally viable solution (the community would support) is to make maps + weapons that clearly stand out from anything people make for free.\nThat takes time and money. The only reason I can get it done in 6 months is because of my skills and exp.\nA good FPS will benefit the whole Arbitrum ecosystem immensely, much more than 25k. Don't forget how many crappy DEXs got 50k+ and they don't contribute anything new, people just farm contract interactions.\nWould you rather see another copy-paste dex, or a game like Halo: Combat Evolved on Arbitrum?\n\n3: What infrastructure will be used for the web3 aspects of Frags, as well as what integrations you expect to have in place for the launch\n\n                                                                                                     Infra:\nweb3 lib: ethers;\nwallet: metamask;\ncompiling, testing, deployment: hardhat;\ninfra: alchemy;\n                                                                                                     web2:\nServers: tbd, I will compare pricing plans at the time of launch;\nfrontend: vue js;\n\n                                                                                                  Integrations:\n\n1. ""Fight for eth/arb/magic"". Two individuals agree on a wager and lock the agreed upon amount in a contract. The contract is fed data from the game and the winner after a set amount of rounds gets the funds. Whether the house takes the cut will be decided when we get closer to the release.\n2. NFT integration into graphics. This can be done only for a select few collections because it is both hard to implement and bloats. This comes after the rest of the graphics are done, so trying to nail the details now is unrealistic. For illustration purposes: this means your in-game character will have a face of a ""Small"" you own.\nI want to stress that the main focus is on fun gameplay and the security of funds. We can and will add functionality as time goes by, but the priority is to get people hooked on the game itself.\n\n4: More information on the background of the other modders from Xonotic you plan on engaging, and confirmation that they indeed will work on the project if the grant is approved\n\nArtists are not available 24/7. No one modding on open source platforms is. \nThey do their work usually pro bono, and that's why they'll mod for a couple of days straight, then not even log in for months. So I'll need to engage artists online dynamically:\n1) It's worth talking to less-proven artists but not paying anything upfront.\n2) For a couple of top guys I will offer a small sum upfront and the rest if they deliver S-class models. \nIt needs to be done tactically, as making a post announcing that I want to poach people from the community would result in an instant ban.\nMost devs despise NFTs, so in many cases, I won't mention it. All they need to know is they will get money if their work is banging.\nI am completely sure that with funds at my disposal, I can deliver within the timeframe.\nWorst case scenario: I suddenly lose my modding abilities + no one wants to earn money doing their hobby. Then nothing or very little is spent and I simply return the funds.\nI can't pull a fast one because Binance cooperates with authorities.\nBest scenario (which is much much more likely): Arbitrum gets a Halo-like game and all the FPS lovers rush to our chain. Absolute game changer for the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>Update ends here<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<\n\n\n\nFPS Frags is based on game platform Xonotic. (open-source GPLv3 license)\nI have been making Xonotic mods on-and-off in my free time for close to ten years now. I call them Frags.\nIf funded, we would be the first web2-viable FPS on Arbitrum.\n\nExtremely easy to ""hop into"" and gather your friends. The game is free to play, connecting your wallet just offers perks.\n""easy to learn, hard to master"" so it offers something for the entire spectrum of players.\nIt is a tried-and-true genre, yet we have nothing of the sort on Arbitrum or any of the competing L2s for that matter.\n\nQ: How does web3 ADD to the user experience at Frags?\nThe same way it does to any other fps. Item ownership. Skin reseleability. Access to more stable servers. Gated parties. Adds options for some, takes nothing away from others.\n\nState of the game: \nI will build Frags on top of Xonotic v0.8.6 which can be obtained \nNote: Old versions have an exploit, if you use a hot wallet, stick to the latest version.\n\nTokenomics:\nMagic is a pretty clear choice. \nIf the Frags token gets released down the line, most would be airdropped to users, based on their ingame playtime, ranking and mod submissions, not based on purchasing power. \nfps enjoyooors > farmers\n\n\n\n\nfunding breakdown:\nstable server & site infra. Core EU Server is a must, depending on finances US and KR/JP servers as well. In that order. ~2000$ \nAudit. ~5000$\nI will need help from a few good modders from the Xonotic (or even Quake) community, guys like mapPolishEr and Ranji.\nI will do the bulk myself, but offering such artists pay-per-map & pay-per-weapon would 100% be worth it. ~15000$\nCode Help ~3000$\n\nWill share my real name only if selected for funding. This is crypto, if Frags takes off, I don't want to walk around with a target on my head. The address I provided is directly linked to my id on Binance, they cooperate with authorities.\n\nDescribe your (or your team's) experience and background.\n\nI have never released a game, but I have extensive MMM (modding, modeling, mapping) exp in multiple oldies (like civ2, doom, quake) as well as the neccessary coding skills (c++, quakec, javascript, node.js, solidity). I am a true Arbinaut. I am a Smol. I've been to the dungeons, hatched eggs and answered Igor's riddles in the Beacon.

TreasureDAO. Is there any other place in web3 with such gaming community? 2. Low fees are essential for small purchases. Impossible on L1. 3. Aesthetics. The core elements of Xonotic environment are very much in line with Arbitrum Logo and themes. Any L2 would benefit from Frags, but these three reasons set arbitrum clear from the pack.",Questbook - Gaming

In Smithonia, the insidious corruption of dark magic threatens to engulf the realm in chaos. In this epic saga, four distinct races; Dwarves, Elves, Humans and Orcs vie for dominion of the land.\n\nOur vision for Smithonia extends beyond conventional gaming, aiming to bridge the gap between Web2 and Web3 while ushering in the next wave of players into the Play-to-Earn (P2E) gaming realm. Here, we want to scale up to millions of players to embark on their gaming journey for free, savoring the immersive player experience we offer. However, only true ownership of the Smithonian and Living Weapon NFTs and partaking in the Web3 experience will grant players the ability to earn and trade valuable items and get the most out of the game.\n\nGame features:\n\n-     MOBA style battle arena with PvP and PvE elements.\n-     Custom character creation to mint your dynamic Smithonian NFTs.\n-     Foundry to upgrade and enchant your dynamic weapons and armour NFTs.\n-     Shop to buy and sell loot, craftables and gear.\n-     Fully networked lobby and tavern for socialising with other Smithonia players.\n-     Friends, parties and other social systems with voice and text chat.\n-     Lore books which comprise collectible book NFTs with puzzles and story.\n-     Interactive DnD style questing system.\n\nFunding breakdown:\n\n[This is a legacy milestone, see end of document for updated Milestone 1]\nMilestone 1: Alpha - Character Creation, Foundry, Shop System, and Networked Lobby (Scheduled for 12/01/23) - $10,000\n\nThe alpha milestone comprises the creation of the initial social and interactive elements within Smithonia. Players will have the ability to log into the game using their wallet on the Arbitrum network. Afterward, they will receive instructions on how to create an in-game account linked to that wallet. Players will then proceed through the character creation process, enabling them to design their own character to their liking. Subsequently, the character will be minted as an NFT and stored in the player's wallet.\n\nOnce players have created their characters, they will spawn into the Retrieved Lands, our fully networked lobby and central hub of the game. This first milestone encompasses the development of the Retrieved Lands, including its core components: the foundry, the shop, the well, and the tavern.\n\n- The foundry is the location for upgrading NFT weapons and armor into more powerful variants. Resources and loot acquired through quests and battles will be used here to enhance player gear, thereby increasing its strength, rarity, and value.\n\n- In the shop, players will have the opportunity to trade their weapons, Smithonians, gear, and loot with other players. This will allow players to earn income as they level up their characters and engage in gameplay.\n\n- The well is an area that will provide a small daily allocation of resources or money linked to the user's account.\n\n- In the tavern, players can socialize in a more intimate setting and engage in networked mini-games, such as chess.\n\n- The networked lobby enables players to interact with each other within the Retrieved Lands. This functionality will allow players to communicate with others, send friend requests, and form teams for MOBA battle arena matches.""\n\n\n\nWeapon Upgrade System. Pre-alpha - artwork and mechanics may change.\n\n\n\nFoundry. Pre-alpha - artwork and mechanics may change.\n\n\n\nCharacter Creation. Pre-alpha - artwork and mechanics may change.\n\nMilestone 2: Beta - MOBA Battle Arena, Questing, and Interactive Lore/Puzzle Books (Scheduled for 2/1/24) - $10,000\n\nIn the beta milestone, our focus is on expanding the MOBA battle arena, enhancing the questing system, and introducing interactive lore and puzzle books. This milestone encompasses the development of the 'supply' elements of the game, specifically the battling and questing features. These features will enable players to earn resources and level up their Smithonians through combat and interactive quests, which they can then spend or use in the already completed Foundry and Shop.\n\nThe MOBA battle arena will be a central attraction of Smithonia, where players will engage in intense battles against both other players and AI opponents. The MOBA will offer a perfect blend of action and strategy, with short rounds in an ever-shrinking arena. Each player will have the opportunity to use in-game (non-Web3) resources to purchase powerful cards and effects from a limited shop to use in combat. Quick decision-making will be crucial, as other players may already acquire certain cards, making adaptation a key strategy. After combat, both victors and losers will be rewarded with valuable experience points for their Smithonians.\n\nSmithonia's questing system will take players on daring adventures into unexplored corners of the world. Utilizing our proprietary AI technology, players will encounter DnD-style choices where their Smithonian's stats can make the difference between success and failure. Depending on the quest scenario and the outcome, players may receive rewards and experience points to level up their characters.\n\nThe interactive lore books represent a unique way to present the story of Smithonia to players. Using X (formerly Twitter) and Discord, we will announce the distribution of limited copies of each lore book to those who are most perceptive and active in the community. Players will have a limited time to claim and mint their NFT book, and there will be fixed quantities in the collection. These books will hold significance as some will contain puzzles for players to solve, leading to treasures or other rewards. Furthermore, other books may simply contain intriguing storylines about past events in Smithonia, but the entire anthology may grant membership to a unique society or provide access to powerful magic and other in-game benefits.\n\nCurrently the lore books are in pre-alpha and a demo of their functionality is available here: \n .\n\n\n\nInteractive Lore Book. Pre-alpha - artwork and mechanics may change.\n\nMilestone 3: Release - Polished Networked Game Loop on PC, iOS, Android + Marketing (Scheduled for 4/1/24) - $5,000\n\nThis final milestone involves refining the game by addressing bugs and fine-tuning mechanics to ensure a fair gaming experience. Additionally, we will conduct tests on economic principles to maintain a balanced supply and demand for various in-game items. During this phase, we will also port the developed WebGL version to iOS and Android platforms, thus expanding our reach to the vast mobile gaming market. Finally, we will allocate available funds for marketing the game through traditional Web2 channels, with the aim of enticing these players into the Web3 version of the game.\n\nWhy would Web2 players want to play, and how can they transition to Web3?\n\nIt's important to note that there are significantly more gamers in Web2 compared to Web3, and there's still substantial growth predicted for Web2 gamers, particularly in the realm of mobile gaming (between 2023 and 2027, mobile gamers are projected to increase by approximately 400 million, reaching 2.3 billion players source). Many Web2 gamers hold negative views of Web3 due to subpar games and questionable business practices by certain Web3 entities. Our goal is to change this perception by offering traditional gamers a superior MMORPG experience with free access to our MOBA battle arena and Retrieved Lands.\n\nThis free 'shareware' model has been employed for many years, allowing players to decide whether they want to financially engage in the full gaming experience. We will employ a combination of in-game wallet custodial technologies and user-friendly crypto on-ramp/off-ramp processes to make the transition to Web3 as seamless as possible for players. Similar to popular titles like Fortnite, Rocket League, Valorant, and Runescape, players will be able to enjoy the base game for free. The choice to transition to Web3 gaming will be entirely up to them.\n\nPast Progress:\nDevelopment of two MVP games (Card Crawler and Golden Harvest).\nPartially networked lobby with the capability to accommodate multiple players.\nCharacter creation system (pending connection to Web3 NFT minting).\nAI questing system (in need of fine-tuning and improvements).\nCreation of multiple lore books and establishment of foundational lore for Smithonia.\nNotable Figures:\nAchieved a trading volume worth 250,000 $MAGIC across all collections.\nFully minted weapons collection (12,300) and distribution of the airdropped legacy pass collection (9,000).\nTeam:\n\nShadowregister (Lead designer and developer): Degree in computer engineering from Digipin Institute of Technology (college for game development).

We are seeking grant funding to achieve a working MVP, which will encompass essential mechanics to create an engaging game loop. These components include:\n\n· A networked character controller\n· Well-balanced and captivating battle arenas\n· A lobby and team system\n· A scoring system with clear victory and defeat conditions\n\nMany potential challenges have already been addressed by our team through prior game development experiences. We will utilize our proprietary Animus top-down game engine (built within Unity) and the networking solution, Photon Fusion, which we have used extensively. The primary obstacle we anticipate is refining the MOBA to be enjoyable and addictive. This will be primarily down to the character controller. We will look to build out a fun, networked and responsive controller. Then we will build out the rest of the MOBA around this. Considerable time will be allocated to bug-fixing, playtesting, and balancing this experience. With the requested grant, we will be able to allocate additional developer and artist resources, ensuring that we can deliver a captivating and fun gaming experience from the very first release of the MVP.\n\nGame references to how our MOBA character controller will play:\n\nPokemon Unite: \nZooba: \nBrawl Stars: \n\nThe reasoning behind focusing on crafting, character creation and the shop system before creating the MOBA game mode (which seems like the main product offering here).\n\nThe goal of Smithonia extends beyond just being a MOBA; the MOBA will serve as one game mode within a broader MMORPG experience. Our plan is to gradually expand and enhance the MOBA, ultimately aiming for it to become a fully-fledged game in its own right. However, it will always be integrated within the larger context of the MMO.\n\nWe are developing systems that allow players to create their own character NFTs, and we prioritize getting this right from the outset to facilitate the addition of new gear and elements to these characters. Character creation, crafting, and the in-game shop form the core elements of the game, ensuring that we won't struggle or rush to provide new content after the game's release.\n\nOne common issue we've observed in many Web3 games across various ecosystems is that they tend to focus on supply first. For instance, players stake an asset, earn a resource, and then have no meaningful use for this resource, leading to overinflation and its eventual devaluation. We're taking a different approach by first addressing the demand for these resources, particularly within crafting and character editing. Subsequently, we'll introduce the MOBA game, which will incorporate both resource consumption and supply mechanisms. This means that from day one, players will have the opportunity to earn rewards from playing the game and also avenues to spend and utilize these rewards.\n\nHow you will be able to accomplish this ambitious six-month roadmap with the grant funding being requested, as well as if you are looking for any other sources of funding to help bolster this development process.\n\nWhile our plans may appear ambitious on paper, in reality, we maintain a modest approach to what we aim to achieve. Our company's core philosophy regarding game production is to rapidly establish a complete game loop, enabling us to pinpoint what is enjoyable and effective. One of the core strengths of Animus is to be flexible enough to pivot on game design to create a more achievable goal to generate a similar result.\n\nConsequently, we will focus on creating an MVP of the game that offers players an enjoyable experience and initiates its own revenue generation. These revenues, stemming from market transactions, battle passes, and cosmetic item sales in both Web2 and Web3, will be reinvested into the ongoing development of the game.\n\nFurthermore, we operate with a lean and experienced team of developers, artists, and writers who understand how to balance work output in accordance with budgets and timelines. We are committed to avoiding over-scoping the game and maintaining a low burn rate to enhance the project's likelihood of success.\n\nThe grant funding will be utilized in combination with our own treasury and company revenues, potential investments into Animus, and other grants we've applied for, including the Arbitrum DAO Gitcoin grant.\n\nRevised Milestone 1: [$7,500] Alpha - Prototype of The MOBA Deadline [ December 28, 2023 ] \n\nKey Objectives: \nDevelop a foundational character \nCreate a networked character controller \nImplement 8-directional movement with dynamic spine animations \nIntroduce the primary weapon - the Staff \nIn our initial phase, we prioritize the development of the Staff as our primary weapon due to its versatility, offering both ranged and melee attack options. Concentrating on this single weapon enables us to craft a polished prototype of combat mechanics. \n\nNotable Features: \nAbility System: Introduce a utility skill that players can select before the game, such as dash, heal, or movement speed boost, with varying cooldowns. \nIn this milestone, we aim to implement all three utilities, with plans to expand this repertoire in subsequent milestones. \n\nBasic Abilities: \nMystic Mist: Create an area enveloped in mist, briefly impairing the precision of foes within, demonstrating crowd control tactics. \nFireWall: Generate a short-range cone of fire, dealing moderate damage. This simulates melee-style attacks, incentivizing close combat engagement. \nUltimate Ability: Unlock a game-changing ultimate that enhances the player's performance for a brief duration. This includes bonus attack speed, increased movement speed, and reduced cooldowns. Moreover, each successful attack during this phase grants the player a small healing effect. \nBasic Attack: Equip the character with a fundamental attack - the Fireball. This enables the character to shoot a small fireball in the aimed direction, inflicting base attack damage. \nPlease note that these abilities may undergo refinements based on playtesting before reaching the first milestone. \n\nOur ultimate goal by the end of December is to deliver a fully functional networked arena where players can engage in team-based battles with clear win and lose conditions. At this stage, all players will control the same character with identical skills and attacks. This serves as a foundation upon which we can later introduce a diverse array of weapons and abilities.\n\nDescribe your (or your team's) experience and background.\n\nSee above for teams experience and background.\n\nPlease provide images (or preferably video) of the current state of your project or game.\n\nImages and links to videos provided above.\n\nWhat makes your project or game different than it's competitors? What is your USP (Unique Selling Point)?\n\nThere are currently no other MOBAs on Arbitrum, and there are only a few in the Web3 space. This game genre, popularized by titles like League of Legends, Dota 2, and Valorant, enjoys a massive following with hundreds of millions of players worldwide. It's renowned for its engaging and fast-paced gameplay. Our unique selling proposition (USP) lies in being one of the first high-quality MOBA games to enter the Web3 market, while also introducing innovative gameplay mechanics to make the experience even more exhilarating. Moreover, we're weaving this game into an expansive MMORPG adventure where players will have access to a wealth of dynamic NFTs, including their characters, weapons, armor, and other gear. The strength and rarity of these NFTs will be determined through gameplay. Those who excel in the game and show unwavering dedication will possess the best items, which they can either sell to other players or use within the game.\n\nWhy are you building on Arbitrum?\n\nArbitrum stands out as an effective and well-established Layer 2 Ethereum roll-up network. Known for its rapid transaction speeds, reliability, and low gas costs, it has undergone rigorous testing over the past few years, including during meme-coin rallies, and has consistently delivered on cost-efficiency and speed. These attributes are critical as we scale up this game to accommodate the millions of players we aim to attract. Furthermore, SmithyDAO was among the pioneering projects launched on Arbitrum, and we have experienced strong support and a sense of belonging within this ecosystem. Our goal is to continue nurturing this relationship within the Arbitrum network and contribute to bringing the next million users onto this chain.",Questbook - Gaming

The Realm team is our first partner.\n\n**For a longform explanation, go here - \n\nThe Spire system begins with our writing team's collaboration with a partner looking for a sophisticated body of lore for their game world.

These contests are competed on by the community, and the team (in the case of our first partner, the Realm team) selects winners. When they select a winner, 100 NFTs are automatically minted and sent to the winners, representing the entry. Contests continue for up to 100 chapters, and will continue as long as admins and creators participate.\n\nThe Realm Spire has 10 completed contests so far - \n\nOur short-term plan is to partner with other ecosystems, with a long-term vision of 114 Spires. As our partners and their communities become comfortable with the Spire system, we will begin rolling out other types of contests (music, audiobook, video, etc).\n\nUltimately, the lore will become the building blocks for creation that has the potential to eventually crowdfund feature-length films & any other artistic dreams that can fit into a digital file.\n\nThe way we structure & decentralize our economy will be as innovative as the Spire system itself, with a holistic tokenomics system that comes from the gradually-emitting tokens won in Spire contests. Each Spire is essentially a node, functioning immutably and emitting tokens, with a centralized authority determining the quality of those mints via winner-selection. The multi-spire decentralization process is slated to take place in 2024, with extensive ideation completed already.\n\nThe necessity for economic clarity is important to us, as we want our artists to focus on their creative talents, and our partners to focus on their game development. Spire allows teams to delegate creative work to their most passionate supporters, reward them in the regularly minted NFTs, and focus on the task of enhancing gameplay through their own tech. \n\nSpire dapp features:\nAutomatic contest & minting process (\n)\nVisual depiction of lore & artwork for each partner (\n)\nGrowing collection of lore & artwork on OpenSea (\n)\nFunding breakdown:\n\nMilestone 1: Second Partnership\n\nCurating six pieces of high-quality lore that encompass all basic aspects of a game's growing ecosystem is no easy task. Spires are designed to last for decades, and need to be created within our quality standards. Our writers have done this for Realm's Spire, and informally for Bridgeworld in 2022. We have established the process, but this will take at least 3-4 weeks, with writing, artwork, and smart contract deployment costs. For our second partner, our frontend team is in the process of expanding the MVP to host multiple Spires.\n\nBefore deploying each Spire, we run a 3-4 day live event in our partner’s discord. This is a choose-your-own-adventure experience that gives the community a taste of what it’s like to impact the lore. This is an off-chain event, with discord emojis used to determine the direction the story takes. When this event ends, we deploy the partner’s Spire smart contract, and its first contests begin. \n\nOur writing team has experience doing these live events even before Spire, having done them for Bridgeworld, Smolverse & others. We’ve found this to be a strong way to garner attention & interest for an ecosystem’s backstory. \n\nWith these costs largely eliminated via grant funding, we will be able to reduce our price point, and select from a larger range of promising partners. This is something we do not take lightly, and are much more interested in developing high-quality partnerships than quickly scaling a copy/pasted version of the Spire smart contract.\n\nMilestone 2: Third Partnership\n\nBy the time we are ready for our third partnership, we will have multi-spire functionality on the \n website, and can continue the above process. We’ll again create six Genesis Texts with collaboration from our third partner, and perform a live event.\n\nMilestone 3: Fourth Partnership\n\nOur fourth partnership will be similar to the third. By this point, we will have done a number of Spires, and the process will become that of a well-oiled machine. The grant will have provided us with a network effect of our own, with both a community of artists and the certainty that receiving a Spire is an opportunity to provide a unique level of depth to a video game. \n\nAs our fourth partnership goes live, we will also have a full plan for decentralization of the entire Spire system. With an economic structure established, the Spire team can put even more focus on curating rich backstories for new partners, and nurturing artists that haven’t received appropriate support elsewhere. We will then move towards our goal of launching exactly 114 Spires. \n\nPlease provide images (or preferably video) of the current state of your project or game.\n\nInteractive Spire visual for Realm (first partner): \n\nPromo video for our first Spire launch: \n\nDapp screenshots:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat makes your project or game different than its competitors? What is your USP (Unique Selling Point)?\n\nThere are three projects we recognize to have been focusing on the broad “blockchain + lore” space. The first two appear to have received significant funding through traditional methods: StoryProtocol & Storygrounds. Both projects are in the whitepaper phase, and to our knowledge have not deployed anything to meaningfully interact with on-chain.\n\nThe other project that bears a resemblance to Spire is FakeGotchis - the Aavegotchi ecosystem’s community-created, on-chain artwork. Their creative platform is tailored solely to their own game, but has found success with nearly $600k volume. It is proof to us that ecosystems find zero-utility artwork NFTs to be a refreshing balance to their game loops and token sinks. This process fosters loyalty and enriches the brand/IP they are creating together.\n\nSpire is the first of its kind and is pioneering a new way to look at tokenizing lore. Allowing everyone to mint things leads to clutter - whereas curated collections such as SuperRare or Artblocks provide a quality standard, allowing them to flourish. To our knowledge, Spire is the first platform to have NFTs automatically minted via competition, added chronologically in a blockchain-like format. \n\nFurther, there are currently very few on-chain projects exploring lore or any sort of minted writing. One of the few with experience in this niche is the Hyype team, who have partnered with us and built our frontend. Hyype’s own platform has a focus on lore for individual NFTs, but with Spire, we took on the challenge of creating a structure for entire ecosystems.\n\nWhy are you building on Arbitrum?\n\nWe’ve found Arbitrum builders to have a longterm focus and a willingness to take creative risks. Since 2021 we have seen the culture grow, and even in poor market conditions, it’s clear that many projects are in it for the long haul. This is imperative for our efforts, as we’d like teams to use their Spire for years to come. \n\nTeam\n\nZach - Founder; formerly professional poker player (12 years); self-published author (Kindle, various short stories); currently specializing in game theory, developing on-chain systems, video game history & mythology\n\n\n\n\nNate - Fiction writer & marketer (10 years); in recent years, crafted off-chain lore for Bridgeworld, Smolverse, KOTE, Shreddin Sassy, Project Godjira, Battlefly, LifeVerse, Beacon, and on-chain lore for the Realm Spire\n\n\n\nJesse - Fiction writer (4 years); focus on world-building with AI & web3 storytelling; crafted off-chain lore for various Treasure ecosystem partners & on-chain for the Realm Spire\n\n\n\nSupriyo - Technical Product Manager, Software engineering & Product Design background; Ethereum native since 2018; Hyype Founder; Previously, led product & design at Alexa; Currently founder at Atrium, curating web3 multimedia\n\n\n\n\nHarry - Project Manager (2 years) at a London-based financial institution; 1 year as founder associate at a successful global trade startup; specialization in systematization and innovation\n\n\n\n\n\nAustin - Solidity (3+ years); Smart contract developer, Ethereum native\n\n\n\n**Below added at request from Flook\n\nKPI's\n\nOur first partner, Realm, has a community dedicated to its Spire curation. There have been 11 completed contests, and 161 submissions approved by the Realm team, who is moderating their Spire. Each batch of five contests lasts 1-2 weeks, and all are heavily contested for, even though there is a single winner for each. Contests get roughly 10 quality submissions. \n\nOur KPI for the Second Partnership (First Milestone): \n\n- Twelve Genesis Texts written by our team minted\n- Live event in second partner discord (4-day community event)\n- Deploy second partner's Spire smart contract, initiating contests\n- 300 cumulative approved submissions (across both Spires)\n- 35 completed contests\n\nKPI for the Third Partnership (Second Milestone:):\n\n- Eighteen total Genesis Texts written by our team minted\n- Live event in third partner discord\n- Deploy third partner's Spire\n- 500 cumulative approved submissions (across all three Spires)\n- 65 completed contests\n\nKPI for the Fourth Partnership (Third Milestone)\n\n- 24 total Genesis Texts written by our team minted\n- Live event in fourth partner discord\n- Deploy fourth partner's Spire\n- 800 cumulative approved submissions across all four Spires\n- 100 completed contests\n- Whitepaper for Spire decentralization plan completed & ready for review\n\nBy this point, Spire will have achieved a solid network effect, and a streamlined partnership framework for on-boarding new ecosystems. We will then look to the future by enhancing contest types to include multimedia of all types, as well as begin development on a holistic tokenomics system that integrates all partners and encourages cross-spire creativity.",Questbook - Gaming

Originally, I was a content creator on YouTube, providing deep dives into emerging trends within Web3 gaming doing my best to act as a “poor man’s venture capitalist”. You can still view much of my content here (\n). After 16 months of creating content on YouTube, I was hired onto an Immutable-X grant recipient game Vy Worlds to help lead their marketing, community, and partnerships functions. I served in that role for eight months, until the project ran out of runway. One of my proudest moments was the hosting of the world’s first play-to-mint event in collaboration with Immutable, Gamestop, and r/Superstonk. We were able to hit a DAU peak of 14k players, which was quite exceptional for our title. Afterward, I co-founded P & G Digital alongside my co-founder Pradeep Sekar (ex-IMX Senior Engineer) to begin working on our layer3 specific to Web3 gaming. We operated our startup for around six months, but with the difficult market were unable to fundraise successfully. I have since begun providing consulting services around marketing and community, most recently working with the Web3 title Last Resort, and the Web2 AI title Embark! As a first-time Founder, I wished that there was a community, where I could receive timely and critical help. From there I created the Gaming Startup Collective and began to build that community.\n\nSection 3: Idea Roadmap / Milestones\nWhat is the idea/project for which you’re applying for a grant? I would like to ask that Arbitrum be an official sponsor of our month’s topic of fundraising. \n\nThis includes:  \n> 7 Industry leading Q/A sessions. Similar to this (\n) \n> 2 Twitter Spaces \n> 1 Podcast \n> 1 Monthly Newsletter \n> Sharing on our socials \n> A special Q/A session with Arbitrum and our community of early-stage gaming founders \n> Specifically inviting and highlighting game Founders within the Arbitrum ecosystem to share their experiences working with your chain. *Note, we have already confirmed Teri Tan from Mighty Bear Games as a guest speaker in late November.  \n\nTell us your plan for implementing your idea/project:  Our guest speakers and events are already scheduled for the month. Each session will be recorded and amplified across our social presence on Twitter, YouTube, Discord, our Podcast, and Linkedin. Our target audience for these events will be the early-stage gaming founders who are within our community. They span the development cycle. You can see the details below.\n\n\n\n\nAre we planning on associating with universities? Not at this time, but a consideration for future events.\n\nWhat is the estimated time of completion for these events? These events will end at the end of November 2023.  \n\nOutline the major deliverables of our project. The Arbitrum brand, and offering were placed in front of early-stage gaming founders routinely and consistently throughout November 2023.  \n\nWhat is the size of funding you expect for completing each milestone of the project? A total distribution of $6,900 will be received, across three milestones, divided into three distributions of $2,300. Project origination. Mid-way check-through on satisfaction with content quality and results. Final distribution at the culmination of the month’s events.  \n\nThese funds will be used for the following:  \n\nSponsorship of each event ($200 per session x 11 sessions) $2,200 - including either reading off a pre-approved script highlighting the Arbitrum chain, or an opportunity for a guest speaker from the ARB community to join and share directly about the chain as an option for builders.\n\nArbitrum exclusive community question/answer session (No additional cost) - we'll invite our community of game developers to join in on a live q/a session with a member from the Arbitrum team to learn directly about the opportunities that exist for game studios to build on your chain.  \n\nYouTube video editing - ($100 per session x 11 sessions) $1,100 - editing our recorded community question/answer sessions, including our intro highlighting the Arbitrum ecosystem, as well as the inclusion of any relevant Arbitrum video assets.  \n\nPodcast editing - ($100 per session x 11 sessions) $1,100 - editing our recorded community question/answer sessions, including our intro highlighting the Arbitrum ecosystem, as well as the inclusion of any relevant Arbitrum video assets.  \n\nContent editing - ($50 per piece x 50 pieces) $2,500 - editing our community question/answer sessions, including our intro highlighting the Arbitrum ecosystem, into short-form video, and text content that will be distributed across Discord, Twitter, Youtube, and Linkedin.  \n\n*Note, if considered mutually successful, we would value the opportunity to discuss a long-term agreement where we highlight the Arbitrum ecosystem monthly. Let’s consider discussing this at the end of the month.\n\nBenchmark milestones: Our idea/ proposal will directly lead to a target user influx into the Arbitrum ecosystem to apply for grants, and learn more about building within your ecosystem.\n\nSection 4:\n\nHow does your idea/project align with the Arbitrum ecosystem? We’re cultivating a community of highly engaged early-stage Web3 gaming Founders. As reported by the Game7 DAO blockchain selection is one of the biggest hurdles for teams looking to build in the space. Our collaboration could provide an easy decision to come and build on Arbitrum.\n\nWhy this idea/project will be a growth force for Arbitrum? Being able to break through the noise to directly speak with and market to early-stage Web3 development teams is critical. That opportunity is presented through a partnership with the Gaming Startup Collective.\n\nHow will your project contribute to the expected benefit of the based on the amount given? A team that onboards to the Arbitrum ecosystem, could easily return multiples over the cost of sponsoring our month’s events.\n\nHow should the Arbitrum community measure the success of this grant? We should measure the amount of quality events and discussions hosted while highlighting the Arbitrum brand. Additionally, we can track how many unique users from our community join Arbitrum’s Discord with a custom invite code. Furthermore, we could track the amount of grant applicants to the Arbitrum grant process, after learning about it from our collaboration.\n\nIn the long term, how will you continue to contribute to the Arbitrum ecosystem? Through our partnership, I’ll become an Ambassador for Arbitrum and hold your team, and offerings top of mind in my interactions with founders. Creating a potential referral network based on our interactions.\n\nNote, several of the events mentioned in this proposal are beginning next week 11/6/2023. As a show of good faith, we'll extend this sponsorship to also include out December event calendar, spanning another 12 events at no additional cost.\n\nTwitter\n\n*This proposal was originally submitted under the Education, Community Growth, and Events section. Manugotsuka had recommended to re-submit it here. \n\nHere are the comments from the original proposal for ease of catching up in the conversation.\n\nManugotsuka\nReviewer\n04 Nov\nHello!

We realized that the metrics of you RRSS and a low, this was because that the acconts are quite new. But how do you plan to improve these metrics to have a better attendance or impact?  \n\n2. While the proposal mentions the intention to collaborate with the Arbitrum ecosystem, could you provide more details on how the project will directly contribute to and integrate with the Arbitrum blockchain?  \n\n3. We will appreciate if you create a detalied budget breakdown in a tool like excel. With this it will be more easy see all expenses related to your proposal.  \n\n4. For each amount requested, we recommend to make a rationale or justification and clarify why those amount and not lower of bigger. Don't foget to put the hours worked or salaries if you have it.\n\nRyan Turner ""NoAutopilot""\nBuilder\n06 Nov\nThank you for these questions. I'll share additional details and answers here in a bit. Thanks!\n\nRyan Turner ""NoAutopilot""\nBuilder\n06 Nov\n1.

Here's a Google Sheet where I've compiled our budget. Let me know if this format works.\n\nManugotsuka\nReviewer\n07 Nov\nHello! after a review of our team and other domain allocators, we conclude that this proposal will have a better impact into the Gaming domain. So please re-submit your proposal in the Gaming Domain. Thank you!\nDescribe your (or your team's) experience and background.\n\nI originally started as a content creator on Youtube, providing deep-dives into the emerging market of Web3 gaming. I think led Marketing, Partnerships, and Community for Knock Knock Games, a Web3 UGC game built be ex-Zynga, TinyCo, and JamCity vets. I then co-founded P & G Digital, a Layer-3 blockchain built specifically for gaming, covering responsibilities of marketing/biz dev. I currently provide consulting / advisory services around community, marketing, and partnerships to both Web2 and Web3 gaming startups. I operate the Token Takeover podcast, interviewing key builders in the Web3 space.

Clique’s Identity Oracles enable users to claim Attestations from their off-chain data which in turn enable the following:\nUser Segmentation\nDirectional Incentives\nSybil Resistance\nIdentity Weighted Governance\nLinks\n\nWebsite: \nGithub: \nTwitter: \nLinkedIn: \nEcosystem Deck: \npw: clique2023\n\nWhat's on your Roadmap?\n\nAt Clique, the two verticals we are currently focused on are Gaming & DeFi where we're focused on building infrastructure that enables users to push out relevant identity data.\nAs a company focused on on-chain identity, we are currently focused on deploying meaningfully across various ecosystems, ensuring we provide value at every echelon of the stakeholder ladder. These will ensure the growth of the chain's respective identity layer.\n\nWhen do you plan to complete it by?\n\nOur Gaming Attestor (Product that pushes data on-chain) is currently live on Arbitrum:\nShould this proposal start, we can cater 2 weeks to make sure we design a FE for this event & test it thoroughly & run it across 2 months.\nProposal\nClique aims to fully disburse this grant sum to incentivise the Arbitrum Gaming Ecosystem to claim their Gaming Attestations with the following data-sets:\nGaming activity (Total hours spent in-game on Steam)\nPreferred genres by playtime\nPreferred game themes by playtime\nPreferred play style by playtime\nSpending Activity (MoM/YoY)\nOnce the users claim the Gaming ID badges, Clique is working on getting Identity Verifiers (Guild) to integrate our schemas & allow users to claim identity-backed gaming discord roles on any Arbitrum Project discord for enhanced player segmentation.\n\nHow this benefits Arbitrum:\nData Insights: Acquiring more precise insights with regards to their users & fostering a right community is paramount to an ecosystem's long term success. Further insights as to their current users would enable the BD/Strategy team to allocate resources where needed (onboard different games, more gamers).\nUser Acquisition\nHow this benefits Games/Protocols:\nSybil Resistance: Our solution prevents the creation of duplicates from the same account. Moreover, the granularity on one’s profile will be enough to assess whether the individual is real.\nGrass-Root Communities: The partnership with identity verifiers enable the first utility when you think of identity: User Recognition. Our solution will enable gaming projects to acquire their target audience & actively involve/reward them through closed-betas/AB testing/surveys/focus groups.\nOptimisation: Games are data-engines. Having insights with regards to a gamer's web2 gaming data can help support more accurate player prediction models.\nUser Acquisition\nHow this benefits users\n\nAll the points above contribute the users:\nSybil resistance affects UA because players don't feel seen or heard to participate in an economy due to the number of bots.\nUsers submitting their web2 gaming data for games to see would enable games they support to further optimise their product & thus create a better CX\nShould there be a majority of gamers (e.g. MOBA lovers) in a chain, the Arbitrum team could look to onboard/further support a web3 game of that sorts.\nNo more discoverability problem: CT is full of noise. Gamers want users, there is no singular touchpoint with the end user.

We are planning to create an activation End of October/Early November for the Arbitrum Ecosystem & were initially going to bootstrap it.\nOur goal? Become the number one Gaming Identity Issuer on Arbitrum.\n\nMilestone 1 (5,000 ARB)\n\nObjective:\n\nDeploy Verax - The Open-Source Attestation Registry where Clique Attestations will live on.\n\nKPI:\nDeploy on Arbitrum Mainnet\nProgress: Not Yet\n\nMilestone 2 (10,000 ARB)\n\nObjective: \nGrowth of the Gaming ID layer of Arbitrum \n\nKPI: \nGet 40,000 Arbitrum Gamers to claim their Gaming ID Badges\nFrom 0-10,000 unique users: 4,000 ARB\nFrom 10,000-20,000 unique users: 3,000 ARB\nHit 40,000 unique users: 3,000 ARB\n\nGet users to claim their Treasure Tag SBT.\nEst. Duration: 2 months.\n\nProgress:  This milestone has not started yet. Will begin after Verax is deployed.\n\nGrant Amount + Spending Plan\n\nWe are requesting for a grant sum of 15,000 ARB.\n\nClique will be claiming 5,000 ARB  for deployment efforts of Verax on Arbitrum One. \n\nFurthermore, we will be using the rest of the 10,000 ARB grant to disburse it to Arbitrum Users & we will be distributing it over the course of 2 months. \n\nAs part of the launch strategy, we will also be catering 5,000 ARB from our own treasury to further incentivise users to claim their gaming identities over the course of the next 2 months.\n\nTo recapitulate, out of this 15,000 ARB:\n5,000 will be paid to the Clique Wallet for the Deployment of Verax\n2,250 will be used for loyalty rewards (1,125 ARB pm)\n6,000 will be used for raffles (3,000 ARB pm)\n2,250 will be used for referrals (1,125 ARB pm)\nClique will be providing 5,000 ARB from our own wallet to be disbursed to members of TreasureDAO who participate\nTreasureDAO\n\nAs part of the launch strategy, we will run an activation alongside the Treasure Ecosystem in the first month where their users will have the chance to take part in this raffle only if they have a Treasure Tag SBT. \n\nThis raffle will last for 2 weeks. \n\nTo participate, they will be required to fulfil a few tasks to aid with the amplification of their Arbitrum Odyssey activation + Platform launch. \n\nTheir $MAGIC will count as participation entries \n\nThere will be 10 winners of 500 $arb each (the more $MAGIC you own, the higher chances of winning)\n\nThis will be a prize pool only accessible to users who are Treasure participants.\n\nRaffle:\nThere will be weekly raffles with multiple prize pots. \n\nThis will take place over 2 months & we will use different engagement platforms.\n\nTo participate in the raffle, all a user will have to do is to claim/update their Gaming ID badge once. Naturally, the more time they do it, the higher the chance they have of winning. Their Gaming Data will also act as a multiplier (total playtime etc).\n\nLoyalty:\nUsers will stand a chance to win 560 Arb for consistency every 2 weeks. \n\nThis will take place over 2 months from launch day.\n\nOn Clique's website, we will build a score board where individuals are able to update their on-chain gaming data daily. The longer the streak, the more entries you get.\n\nReferrals\n\nA referral counts when a user has utilised a Arbinaut's Gaming Attestation referral link and the user has claimed their own Gaming Attestations.\n\nEach week, 280 ARB will be distributed amongst the top 50 referrals score of that week.\n\nWhy Request this grant?\n\nWeb3 users broadly understand the value of Identity Infrastructure, but fail to understand its importance as there have been no widespread use cases. \nAt Clique, we’re here to change that. In that line of thought, the first order of business is getting Arbinauts to claim their Gaming Attestations which is why we are planning on using this grant to grow a reliable reputation and identity stack, through incentivizing users to push their web2 gaming data on-chain.\n\nWe will be fully disbursing the grant to the community through the organisation of Ecosystem Wide Activations which will serve to build a more robust identity layer across the chain.\n\nFurthermore, we will be aiming to partner up with TreasureDAO to ensure the maximum amount of gamers take part in this initiative.\n\nThis will be similar to the activation we've done as the first gaming identity solution deployed on Ronin - for a more insightful breakdown of what the user flow looks like - please view the following video tutorial:\n\n\n\nOur current focus is on growing the Gaming Identity Layer & identifying core powers/gamers within the ecosystem to build out this gaming network more efficiently.\n\nTeam\n\nKevin Yu - CEO/ Co-Founder\nDescription: Previous serial entrepreneur in the healthcare/RE sector.\nMath & CS from Duke\nLinkedIn: \n \n\nJaden Rafael Yan - CMO/ Co-Founder\nDescription: Jaden was previously the founder of a video production company that executed marketing campaigns for brands like Porsche, Bentley and many others.\nMarketing & Finance from NUS\nLinkedIn:\n \n\nHan Wu - CTO\nDescription: 12 years of combined experience at Citi/Brevan Howard before starting an asset management firm.\nMasters in CS from Cambridge\nLinkedIn:\n\n\nTelegram\n\njpeg_yakuza",Questbook - New Protocols and Ideas

We recognized the paradox of choice and the paralysis it can induce. With a plethora of yield farming pools, liquidity mining programs, and staking opportunities, the average user is often overwhelmed, if not entirely deterred. Our mission is to facilitate DeFi adoption by demystifying these complexities, and creating simple easy-to-use web3 products, thereby bringing more users and capital into the web3 universe.\nOne Click Core Team\nMax Yampolsky (CEO)\n4x founder\nIT & Product background\nFounded AI marketing SaaS \n with $1.2m+ ARR\nLaunched crypto trading firm with $12.4m+ AUM\n#1 Google-ranked web3 & tokenomics writer\nBuilt and managed remote distributed teams of 40+ people (devs, researchers, marketers)\nRoman Slysh (Technical Product Manager)\nMaster's degree in Computer Science\nFormer Big Data and Mobile Engineer with 7+ years of experience\nFormer Founder of Staking as a service with master nodes in Solana, Cosmos-based blockchains\nManaged the development of one of the leading DEX and assisted in its M&A\nLead engineer at the world's first trustless crypto-bank - Minexbank\nIan Huryanau (Tech Lead)\nHave successful experience in a CTO position in several enterprise projects in tech, DeFi, and web3\nOne of the first in the Viber Web Team, leaded the most difficult project\nWas a participant in the Audi development team\nLead of the Airbnb Integration team\nCertified Jira, Kanban, GitLab specialist\nLead the Unit in one of the biggest Learning Platform\nLázaro Nascimento (Full-Stack Engineer)\nSenior Full Stack Engineer with expertise in blockchain and machine learning, focused on driving business growth through innovative tech solutions.\nSkilled in React, Node.js, Python, Solidity, and Ethereum; adept at creating secure, scalable, user-friendly decentralized applications.\nDeveloped DeFi products with with seamless UI (React) and robust server (Node.js/Express), and designed AI for blockchain portfolio analysis.\nNate Lawson (Head of Product Growth)\nEx.

Marketing Lead at Dapper Labs\nPavel Hilman (CCO)\nFounder of web3 accelerator Hilman Ventures\n12+ years in tech & startups\nFounder of web3 bank of influencers\nFounder in Medtech, Agritech, Blockchain\nOur vision for Arbitrum\nWe envision Arbitrum as the ultimate hub for DeFi yield users, a sanctuary that caters to both the retail people dipping their toes into yield farming and the institutional giants seeking robust, scalable solutions. We see a future where Arbitrum's already rich ecosystem is further enriched by a diverse array of yield opportunities, each meticulously analyzed and made easily accessible through tools like One Click Crypto.\nOur platform aims to be the compass that guides users through Arbitrum's DeFi landscape, enabling them to make informed decisions that align with their risk tolerance and goals. In doing so, we believe we can elevate Arbitrum from being a participant in the DeFi revolution to becoming its epicenter.\nGrant reasoning\nWe want to see Arbitrum thrive as a DeFi hub, yet, we believe its ecosystem lacks UX-friendly tools for onboarding new users/capital into the network. With One Click Crypto team expertise and tooling, we are confident we can help to onboard more retail and institutional capital into the ecosystem further facilitating Arbitrum mass adoption.\nGrant allocation\nThe grant will be allocated to, partially, cover the following deliverable:\nImplementation of the Public Arbitrum DeFi Yield Explorer (database)\nCreating and populating the largest public top-50 Arbitrum yield database with a detailed info on more than 2,000+ Arbitrum yield opportunities\nFrontend implementation & design\nIntegration of real-time data feeds and risk scoring for the available yield pools and assets\nImplementation of yield composability map, which will help DeFi users to identify Arbitrum-based pools and protocols interconnectable with each other\nHow It Brings Value To Arbitrum\nThe DeFi landscape, especially on Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum, is vast and continually evolving. While this dynamism is a testament to the ecosystem's vibrancy, it can also be overwhelming for both new and seasoned investors. This is where One Click Crypto's Public Yield Explorer comes into play.\n1. Easier access to Arbitrum yield opportunities\nTransparency: By creating an open-source database, One Click Crypto ensures that all yield opportunities on Arbitrum are transparent and accessible to everyone, irrespective of their experience or position size.\nEducation: The database serves as an educational tool, helping users understand different yield strategies, their mechanics, and potential advantages.\n2. Qualified risk assessment and transparency of yield - more secure and informed ecosystem\nInformed Decisions: Integrating risk assessment protocols allows users to gauge the potential risks associated with each yield opportunity. This feature empowers users to make informed decisions based on their risk tolerance.\nSafety: By highlighting potential red flags or vulnerabilities, the database can steer users away from dubious or high-risk projects, enhancing the overall safety of capital allocation on Arbitrum.\nRisk assessment is at the heart of One Click Crypto. Each DeFi protocol and its corresponding DeFi pools are analyzed for possible risk vectors to the end user that will result in loss of funds. The risk assessment is done by aggregating the data from several partners (auditing providers) and processing it through the internal framework and methodology. In the end, each protocol, pool, and asset gets assigned a Risk/Safety Score from 1-10 giving it a quantifiable metric that helps a user do due diligence on a given DeFi strategy.\n3. Up-to-date insights and advanced ecosystem analytics\nUp-to-date Insights: With real-time data feeds, users get a snapshot of the current state of yield opportunities, including APY, TVL, and more. This ensures that decisions are based on the most recent data.\nMarket Dynamics: Understanding shifts in TVL, yield rates, and other metrics can offer insights into market sentiments and trends, aiding in strategic decision-making.\n4. Comprehensive Yield Composability Map: Understand how protocols can be linked with one another\nOptimized Strategies: This map visually represents how different yield opportunities can be combined. It aids users in crafting optimized yield strategies by understanding how various protocols can complement each other.\nInnovation: By showcasing composability, the database can inspire developers to create novel financial products that leverage multiple protocols.\n5. Boosting Arbitrum's Reputation\nTrust: A comprehensive, transparent, and user-friendly database can improve trust in the Arbitrum ecosystem, attracting more users and developers.\nGrowth: By simplifying the yield farming landscape, One Click Crypto can drive more capital into Arbitrum, fostering growth and innovation.\nIn conclusion, this phase of One Click Crypto, the Public Yield Explorer, is designed to be a cornerstone in the Arbitrum ecosystem. By providing clarity, safety, and insights, it ensures that both novice and experienced web3 users can navigate the DeFi landscape with confidence, thereby solidifying Arbitrum's position as a leading hub for yield farming.\n\nGrant Milestones\nImplementation of the public Arbitrum yield database.

Tally provides an end-to-end decentralization stack, making it easy for teams to launch governance, ship software upgrades, and fund initiatives.\n\nTeam Members and Qualifications:\n\nFrisson 1 (VP of Growth at Tally 4, Arbitrum Delegate, Founder of Content Guild , Founder of DAO NYC 1)\nDennison Bertram 1(Founder and CEO of Tally 4, Builder of Tally Zero, Founder of Dope Wars 2, Builder of Safeguard 1& much more )\nRafael Solari 4(Founder and CTO of Tally 4, Committee Member of Uniswap Deployments Accountability Committee)\nProject Links:\nWebsite: https://www.tally.xyz/ 58\nDocumentation: https://docs.tally.xyz/ 6\n\nContact Information\nTG: @zeroxfrisson\n\nTwitter: @0xfrisson\n\nEmail: frisson@tally.xyz\n\nDo You Acknowledge That Your Team Will Be Subject to a KYC Requirement?: Yes\n\nSECTION 2: GRANT INFORMATION\nDetail the requested grant size, provide an overview of the budget breakdown, specify the funding and contract addresses, and describe any matching funds if relevant.\n\nRequested Grant Size: 200k ARB\n\nGrant Matching: n/a\n\nGrant Breakdown:\nThe purpose of this grant is to incentivize growth of the DAO ecosystem on Arbitrum and Arbitrum Nova. Today, Tally supports over 500 DAOs with a collective TVL over $10 Billion. DAOs have moved over $100 Million via Tally proposals. The Arbitrum DAO itself is one of Tally’s power users, representing almost $4 Billion in TVL. However, outside of the Arbitrum DAO itself, the DAO ecosystem on Arbitrum is still nascent. Tally supports only 9 DAOs on Arbitrum and 0 on Arbitrum Nova. We believe a healthy onchain DAO ecosystem is one of the most important signals of ecosystem quality and staying power. The best projects in crypto are managed transparently via onchain governance, where no one entity or group controls the admin keys. Application leaders across Ethereum like Uniswap, ENS, and Compound use Tally because it’s the standard for operating onchain governance. Arbitrum is a DeFi rich environment, which would provide DAOs multiple ways to natively deploy a treasury leveraging the countless native protocols on Arbitrum. We believe incentivizing existing and new protocols on Arbitrum to deploy onchain governance and operate on Tally will drive sustainable growth in the ecosystem.\n\nFunding Address: arb1:0x50Db58E1774CB7922d1bF96a267b52e8bb41c0ce\n\nFunding Address Characteristics:\nTally company Safe multisig 2/3 on Arbitrum with Frisson, Raf, and Dennison as signers\n\nContract Address:\nThe incentive funds will be deployed into the Governor contracts of Arbitrum DAOs on Tally, including DAOs that are currently live on Tally and DAOs that are created during the incentive program period. I’ve included the current list of Governor contract addresses below (excluding the Arbitrum DAO itself). The future addresses are unknown at this time, but will be included once deployed.\n\nSWEEPR 0xC0507cFC6A9E65894C05C1c5b193C7B58b36791f\nImmutable 0x8FBF62eEA6Dc9493836A182DD66db02bFfF10695\nLondon DAO 0x936139366c5db48543368EE9cD075267d176a02c\nOdyssey DAO 0xbCC46a8D83B6f16e5b8A99116B4467B82EB04F01\nGMX Blueberry Club 0x28C3ABA27542e0680Cc3706AEdebFA40bBF9AF1E\nSECTION 3: GRANT OBJECTIVES AND EXECUTION\nClearly outline the primary objectives of the project and the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) used to measure success. This helps reviewers understand what the project aims to achieve and how progress will be assessed.\n\nObjectives:\n\nWe intend to leverage the funds to drive adoption of onchain DAOs on Arbitrum. Tally is the industry standard application for onchain governance. We are already speaking with multiple protocols and dev teams who are interested in deploying their DAO on Tally or migrating their existing governance to Tally. We will use these funds to incentivize those teams to make Arbitrum their home.\n\nKey Performance Indicators (KPIs):\n\nNumber of DAOs deployed on Tally\nTVL growth of Arbitrum DAOs on Tally\nAmount of value transferred via Arbitrum DAOs on Tally\n\nHow will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem?: We will directly use the grant to incentivize existing DAOs on Arbitrum to grow and to attract teams to operate their DAOs on Arbitrum. Governance is at the heart of any protocol. Growing DAO-managed assets on Arbitrum leads to protocol growth (the Arbitrum Short Team Incentive Program being a perfect example). We have an existing pipeline of customers who are planning to launch and/or grow their governance on Tally. We will deploy incentive funds directly into the governance contracts of those DAOs.\n\nJustification for the size of the grant: We plan to offer an average grant size of 10k ARB to incentivize ~20 protocols to grow their DAOs on Arbitrum. We will scale the grant size up or down depending on the TVL of the DAO. We will implement a minimum TVL and other requirements (must pass at least one proposal) before the grant is given out.\n\nExecution Strategy and Timeline: We plan to actively work with projects to grow and deploy on Arbitrum and anticipate being able to deploy the grant by Jan. 31, 2024. Execution will be a manual, careful, partnership-based process that involves working closely with projects to grow their existing governance contracts and deploy new governance contracts on Arbitrum.\n\nDo you accept the funding of your grant streamed linearly for the duration of your grant proposal, and that the multisig holds the power to halt your stream? Yes\n\nSECTION 4: PROTOCOL DETAILS\nProvide details about the Arbitrum protocol requirements relevant to the grant. This information ensures that the applicant is aligned with the technical specifications and commitments of the grant.\n\nIs the Protocol Native to Arbitrum?: Yes. We have long supported Arbitrum and Arbitrum Nova. The Arbitrum DAO is Tally’s most important client.\n\nOn what other networks is the protocol deployed?: The current list of networks Tally supports can be found here: Network Support - Tally Docs 3\n\nWhat date did you deploy on Arbitrum?: August 25th, 2022\n\nProtocol Performance:\n\n$10B of TVL in DAOs on Tally\n$100M of value transferred via Tally proposals\n500+ DAOs on Tally\n5,000+ proposals passed on Tally\nSECTION 5: Data and Reporting\nProvide details on how your team is equipped to provide data and reporting on grant distribution.\n\nIs your team prepared to create Dune Dashboards for your incentive program?: Yes, we will create Dune dashboards that provide visibility into all the Arbitrum DAOs on Tally that received grants via the incentive program funds, including details such as TVL, proposals passed, delegates, and votes. We have experienced data engineers at Tally who can deliver on this reporting.\n\nDoes your team agree to provide bi-weekly program updates on the Arbitrum Forum thread? Yes\n\nDoes your team acknowledge that failure to comply with any of the above requests can result in the halting of the program’s funding stream?: Yes",Short Term Incentive Program

Please note that the numbers are averages, and actual disbursement will follow the ratios under the ‘Emission Schedule 6’. More details can be found under the ‘Execution Strategy’ section of this application.\n\nSection	Total ARB	%	Weekly Average\nLiquidity Mining Emissions	90,000	45%	5,625 ARB\nBoosted Yields	110,000	55%	6,875 ARB\nFunding Address:\n\n0x4f54Cab19B61138e3c622a0bD671C687481eC030 - Arbitrum Multisig\n\nFunding Address Characteristics:\n\n3/7 Safe Multisig Wallet\n\nContract Address:\n\n0x4f54Cab19B61138e3c622a0bD671C687481eC030 - Arbitrum Multisig\n\nSECTION 3: GRANT OBJECTIVES AND EXECUTION\nObjectives:\n\nAs a CDP protocol, Savvy focuses on increasing bottom-line metrics like user deposits and loan origination. The primary objectives of the grant are to increase incentives across the Savvy products to enhance adoption and to increase liquidity depth across pools to strengthen project health.\n\nBoost yields to capture users from competing EVM chains.\n\nIncrease Liquidity Mining Emissions in ARB to increase stable swap pool health.\n\nIncrease trust and legitimacy by being part of the Arbitrum Grant Ecosystem.\n\nKey Performance Indicators (KPIs):\n\nSavvy will measure the direct metrics of the above Objectives to assess performance.\n\nIncrease in deposits to the Savvy protocol.\n\nIncrease in borrowing from the Savvy protocol.\n\nIncrease in TVL of stable swap pools of the Savvy protocol.\n\nIncrease in the overall volume across the Savvy protocol.\n\nNumber of unique users interacting with the Savvy protocol.\n\nHow will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem?:\n\n1) Grow Arbitrum User Base\n\nAlthough Arbitrum has $2.7bn of TVL, most are in perpetual, cross-collateral lending and dexes. These verticals are a huge part of DeFi. However, they also leave out a large subset of users in DeFi.\n\nSavvy protocol focuses on simplicity, safety, and risk aversion to bring in the masses to unlock their capital and lower their opportunity cost. Savvy is paramount to this, and all strategies available on the protocol are heavily researched before implementation.\n\nHaving the grant from the Arbitrum Foundation will allow Savvy to boost yields higher compared to competing projects in other EVM chains. Higher yields will create a natural onboarding funnel for all customer segments, driving more retail adoption and increased transaction and wallet activity.\n\nFurthermore, Savvy recently deployed into Bunni and currently represents over 50% of their TVL on Arbitrum. Liquis has stated that they will be willing to expand to Arbitrum when Bunni reaches $2m in TVL. In this regard, Savvy will also foster growth in the available projects in the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\n2) Increase Capital Efficiency within Arbitrum\n\nWhat’s unique about Savvy is its collaborative approach with the existing DeFi protocols on Arbitrum; Savvy vaults can be built over almost everything. Instead of competing with other protocols, Savvy complements them by depositing funds into them, thus enhancing their TVL without detracting from other projects. By providing additional yield on Arbitrum protocols such as GMD and JonesDAO, Savvy unlocks the dormant value in their yield tokens such as gmdUSD and jUSDC.\n\n3) Increase Value Proposition of Savvy Ecosystem\n\nIncreasing the TVL across Savvy will allow Savvy to open new vault options, deepening Savvy’s integrations with the rest of the Arbitrum DeFi ecosystem. Furthermore, being the only project to offer BTC-denominated loans, Savvy will drive BTC holdings to Arbitrum.\n\nJustification for the size of the grant:\n\nSavvy is a protocol launched with less than 2% pre-sale with no VC funding and acts as a community-owned DAO. Since our liquidity bootstrapping event in mid-August, Savvy DAO has already voted on two proposals.\n\nOur primary challenge is secondary market liquidity, and increasing yields is an essential component of the collaborative ecosystem approach that strengthens the overall Arbitrum DeFi landscape. The grant we seek is not merely a transaction; it is an investment in the future of decentralized finance on Arbitrum.\n\nThe distribution in the schedule above, on top of the current protocol rewards, will create an approximately 120% increase in Liquidity Mining Emissions and a 7x increase in Savvy Booster yields over 16 weeks. As Savvy Booster yields are directly related to protocol debt, a case table is provided under the Execution Strategy below. These ratios and amounts are a healthy mix to scale both sides of the system.\n\nExecution Strategy:\n100% of the grant will be used for protocol participation in three ways. Incentives will be distributed weekly from 14 October 2023 through 27 January 2024 for 16 weeks.\n\n1) Liquidity Mining Emissions\n\nAs a CDP protocol, Savvy relies on its stable swap pools for healthy protocol performance by design. Under the SVY tokenomics, 39% of the total supply is allocated for this over six years. Currently, Savvy keeps pools and runs Market Making Campaigns on two key DEXs: Trader Joe and Uniswap.\n\nTrader Joe LP rewards are calculated using our in-house subgraphs and are claimable on the Savvy app. Uniswap LP rewards are claimable by staking through Timeless Finance’s Bunni liquidity engine. Due to the structure of both systems, rewards in the form of ARB can easily be included in addition to the current SVY rewards.\n\nFunds allocated for Liquidity Mining Emissions will be divided and distributed with the weekly ‘Emission Schedule 6’. The list of pools is subject to change with a Savvy DAO proposal. Still, it will always include SVY or a svToken synthetic as one of the pairs.\n\nTreasury-controlled wallets will be excluded from the ARB incentives.\n\nBelow are the average weekly allocations for the available pools:\n\nPool	Platform	Weekly Average\nsvUSD-USDC	Trader Joe	675 ARB\nsvETH-ETH	Trader Joe	675 ARB\nsvBTC-WBTC	Trader Joe	387 ARB\nSVY-WETH	Trader Joe	756 ARB\nsvUSD-FRAX 3	Uniswap (Bunni)	956 ARB\nsvETH-frxETH	Uniswap (Bunni)	956 ARB\nSVY-WETH	Uniswap (Bunni)	1,087 ARB\n2) Boosted Protocol Yields\n\nSavvy uses a novel mechanism called the Savvy Booster to incentivize healthy protocol use through long-term staking of the SVY token. 7% of the total SVY supply has been allocated for this. Users who deposit into Savvy and have an open credit line earn additional yield based on their veSVY amount accrued by staking their SVY.\n\nFunds allocated for boosting protocol yields will be distributed to eligible users as ARB alongside SVY rewards. More information on the Savvy Booster can be found here 1.\n\nThe table below shows the effective boost increase per $ of debt in the Savvy protocol. Please note that this calculation does not factor in SVY or ARB price changes.\n\nProtocol Debt Amount	Boost Increase\n$220,000	1 x (current)\n$220,000	12.50 x\n$500,000	5.50 x\n$1,000,000	2.75 x\n$1,500,000	1.83 x\n$2,000,000	1.37 x\n$2,500,000	1.1 x\nTo protect against unrealistic increases in yields, Savvy reserves the right to decrease the amounts where appropriate.\n\nGrant Timeline:\n\nThe distribution is planned to be concluded by 27 January 2024.\n\nDo you accept the funding of your grant streamed linearly for the duration of your grant proposal, and does the multi sig holds the power to halt your stream?:\n\nYes.\n\nSECTION 4: PROTOCOL DETAILS\nIs the Protocol Native to Arbitrum?:\n\nYes.\n\nOn what other networks is the protocol deployed?:\n\nArbitrum only.\n\nWhat date did you deploy on Arbitrum?:\n\n06/12/2023\n\nProtocol Performance:\n\nAfter our soft launch of Savvy in June, our Market Making Campaign produced over $1.6m of pool liquidity across our three synthetic pools within three weeks. This resulted in over $400k of immediate Protocol Owned Liquidity.\n\nOur Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool in early August generated 321 ETH from over 350 participants, and more than 35% of our non-team controlled float is deposited in our staking contract.\n\nCurrently, Savvy has $695k TVL in Strategies provided by AAVE, Jones DAO, and GMD.\n\nSavvy’s total volume is approximately $2.2m USD at current-day spot prices for ETH and BTC for the past 30 days. Performing this calculation using TWAP instead, the volume will likely exceed the recommended $2m USD criterion.\n\nProtocol Roadmap:\n\nThe Mid-term roadmap of Savvy includes turning on fiat ramps, gauge voting for Savvy pools, and starting protocol redemptions in addition to the constant addition of strategies, collateral types, and use cases.\n\nAudit History:\n\nHalborn has audited Savvy, and no Critical or High-importance issues have been detected. The report can be found here.\n\nSECTION 5: Data and Reporting\nIs your team prepared to create Dune Dashboards for your incentive program?:\n\nYes. Our team is capable of creating the requested dashboard by the Arbitrum Foundation.\nOur team has been building internal dashboards and tools on multiple platforms such as Savvy Retool 1 and Savvy Netlify 3 since day one.\n\nWe have also built the first subgraph for Trader Joe Liquidity Book to track metrics and distribute rewards.\n\nWe have already built a Savvy Dune Dashboard 6 to calculate the total protocol volume, as reported in Section 4.\n\nDoes your team agree to provide bi-weekly program updates on the Arbitrum Forum thread?:\n\nOur team agrees to provide bi-weekly program updates on the KPIs listed in this grant application.\n\nDoes your team acknowledge that failure to comply with any of the above requests can result in the halting of the program’s funding stream?:\n\nYes.",Short Term Incentive Program

New Arbitrum DEX LP’s and trending tokens will be continually added on an ongoing basis providing users more opportunities to use OpenOcean as their one-stop trading partner.\n\nUser Referrals: We plan to introduce a referral program that incentivizes users to invite others and share their experience on Arbitrum. This program seeks to attract new users to the ecosystem and encourage existing users to actively participate in current events, fostering a sense of community and growth. Refer to our previously successful referral program here. 5\n\nBoost Trading Volumes for OpenOcean and integrated Arbitrum DEXs: Through integration with all the DEXs in the Arbitrum ecosystem, we anticipate a significant increase in trading volume for each of them, aided by swap incentives we have distributed from the grants. Our platform’s ability to source liquidity from various decentralized exchanges will enhance Arbitrum’s overall trading ecosystem, making it more vibrant, competitive and easy to use for first-time aggregatees\n\nAttracting New Projects to onboard Arbitrum : OpenOcean plans to attract high-quality projects to Arbitrum by offering access to API/SDK/Widget and dev resources for inter-protocol integrations as well as attracting multichain projects which are currently not yet deployed on Arbitrum. Through the grant, we will provide projects with the necessary tools and co-partnership incentives for end users to help build and innovate on Arbitrum for now and for the future of the network. By working with new on-chain deployments we can make sure we are systematically contributing towards building the best on-chain ecosystem possible and pushing for the sustainable success of Arbitrum and L2 Ethereum scaling goals.\n\nJustification for the size of the grant:\n\nOpenOcean is one of the most widely used and far reaching aggregators in the Defi world. The platform sits strategically positioned to attract, guide and support the next wave of crypto users from 2024 and beyond. Doesn’t matter if you’re a trader, LST staker, web3 gamer, NFT hoarder or chart aficionado, OpenOcean is the crypto-swiss-army-knife every DeFi and crypto user needs.\n\nSince launching on Arbitrum, OpenOcean has held a historic track record of helping to promote and foster positive growth within the Arbitrum ecosystem. From incentive programs and awareness campaigns to onboarding new multichain protocols and launching dedicated tooling on Arbitrum, our ambitions aren’t limited to just indexing liquidity. With every new development, tweak or routing update we push, we try to support as many users as possible, Arbitrum has always been a chain where we look to launch new features first.\n\nFor reference, here’s a quick look into our existing stats showcasing our existing impact on Arbitrum ecosystem:\n\nCollectively executed $344m+ volume on Arbitrum with 275k+ transactions\nOpenOcean has served 75k unique wallets on Arbitrum\nIntegrated 53 liquidity sources across the ecosystem, the most of any aggregator\nPartnered with leading DeFi protocols in the ecosystem offering products from our swap and builders suite, such as MetaMask, DeFiLlama, Camelot, GMX, Vela, Interport, Li.Fi, ZyberSwap.\nLaunched 2 major successful quests on Arbitrum with 145k+ participants and 134k+ participants 1\nExecution Strategy:\n\nGiven our role as a leading DEX aggregator featuring smart routing, the uplift in trading and user volumes we drive will benefit not only our platform, but will also be channeled to all DEXs on Arbitrum via our smart routing. This creates a mutual win, boosting the whole Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\n1. Swap Trading Cost Rebates (35%):\n\nAllocation: 35% of the grant will be dedicated to swap trading cost rebates within the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nExecution: We will deploy these cost rebates strategically to enhance trading activity within Arbitrum. These incentives will be structured to attract traders to participate actively on Arbitrum-based decentralized exchanges.\n\nUse of Funds: The funds allocated for swap trading cost rebates will be used to provide refund to users based on their trading volumes and trading frequency.\n\nRisk Management: To manage the risks associated with rebates, we will closely monitor the effectiveness of the program through regular data analysis. Adjustments to the rebate structure will be made if necessary to ensure that the program achieves its intended goals. Also on-chain monitor will help block any suspicious bot activity.\n\n2. Inbound Cross-Chain Swap Incentives (20%):\n\nAllocation: Another 20% of the grant will be allocated to inbound cross-chain swap incentives.\n\nExecution: We will use these incentives to attract users from various blockchain networks to Arbitrum. OpenOcean’s cross-chain swap aggregators will play a pivotal role in this process. Users will be incentivized to explore Arbitrum by providing cross-chain swap incentives.\n\nUse of Funds: The funds will be used to provide incentives for users who migrate their assets from other chains to Arbitrum. This will involve designing attractive reward structures that encourage cross-chain activity.\n\nRisk Management: To mitigate risks, we will closely monitor the success of these incentives in attracting users from other chains to prevent bots involved.\n\n3. Referral Program Incentive Emission (20%):\n\nAllocation: 20% of the grant will be dedicated to the implementation of a referral program.\n\nExecution: Our referral program is designed to drive more traffic and active new users to Arbitrum contracts, aligning with incentivizing existing user interaction within the Arbitrum network.\n\nDistinct from other referral programs, Referrers will receive ARB tokens from our contract via a user-friendly UI, equivalent to up to 50% of their gas fees on Arbitrum, and the referred gets up to 40% rebate, paid in ARB tokens, this will directly foster interaction with Arbitrum contracts.\n\nThe referral program’s distribution and calculations are trackable on-chain. We already have the system and UI ready, the next step is to integrate it with Arbitrum to enable payments in ARB. Refer to our previously successful referral program here. 5\n\nWe will implement anti-Sybil Attack measures and prohibit self-invites to maintain the program’s integrity.\n\nUse of Funds: The allocated funds will be used to provide referral rewards and bonuses to users who refer others to Arbitrum. This will stimulate organic growth and community engagement.\n\nRisk Management: The success of the referral program will be monitored closely through user participation and growth metrics. Adjustments will be made once we detect potential Sybil Attack.\n\n4. Partnership Incentive Program to traders(25%):\n\nAllocation: The remaining 25% of the grant will be dedicated to a partnership incentive program to end users of partner projects.\n\nExecution: The purpose of the “Partnership Incentive Program to traders” segment is to attract more partners to join the Arbitrum ecosystem and to draw partners’ users to Arbitrum through the integration of OpenOcean‘s easy-to-use Arbitrum API/SDK & Widget.\n\nWe will initiate integration with wallets, DeFi projects, decentralized game projects, and any other projects on Arbitrum that may involve trading function to realize this goal.\n\nDue to market fluctuations, we will disclose the addresses of the contracts we intend to incentivize upon completion of the integration process.\n\nUse of Funds: Funds will be used to support co-partnership incentive program to traders, joint initiatives, and rewards for users of partner projects that enhance the Arbitrum network. This will foster a collaborative environment and attract high-quality projects to onboard Arbitrum.\n\nRisk Management: The success of partnerships will be measured by the number of integrations and the impact of partner projects on Arbitrum’s ecosystem. Ongoing communication with partners will ensure the effective use of funds and alignment with shared goals.\n\nGrant Timeline:\n\nWe plan to allocate and distribute the ARB from the STIP grant over a period of 4 months (estimated from October 2023 to January 2024, as per the program requirements). The start date and end date are dependent on when the grant is finally received.\n\nDo you accept the funding of your grant streamed linearly for the duration of your grant proposal, and that the multisig holds the power to halt your stream?

https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rysk-final-stip-round-1/17194,"SECTION 1: APPLICANT INFORMATION\nApplicant Name: Dan\n\nProject Name: Rysk\n\nProject Description: Rysk is a DeFi options protocol. Rysk’s main product is the Dynamic Hedging Vault (DHV), an AMM (Automated Market Maker) and RFQ (Request for Quotation) protocol generating uncorrelated returns for its liquidity providers whilst enabling anyone to trade options with a wide range of strike prices and expiry dates. DHV is targeting a market neutral position for liquidity providers by hedging using price actions in the options or by trading delta with protocols in the Arbitrum ecosystem such as GMX and Rage trade.\n\nTeam Members and Qualifications:\n\nDan: co-founder.

We believe there is a significant opportunity to attract new options traders to the Arbitrum Ecosystem and increase trading volumes across the entire space. Therefore, the objective of the grant is to on-board new options traders into the Arbitrum ecosystem, accelerate Rysk’s growth and position Arbitrum as the primary chain to trade decentralized options. To achieve this, we propose distributing grants to the key participants in the Rysk ecosystem.\n\n1. Traders\nTraders are a critical component of the Rysk protocol since the DHV Revenue Potential is a function of Spread and Volume and the risk is a function of the Inventory Turnover. The higher the volumes and the inventory turnover the higher will be the profitability for the LPs.\n\nFor this reason, we are targeting traders to receive incentives based on their volumes and based on their trading impact to increase the DHV inventory turnover to reduce risk exposure of the pool.\n\n2. Liquidity Providers\nLiquidity is one of main drivers to increase volumes and trading activity to Rysk. Higher liquidity allows traders to make large sized trades with minimal slippage and narrow bid / ask spreads. In order to attract more liquidity and increase cumulative returns for depositors, grants will be distributed to Liquidity Providers based on their stake in the DHV. The target is to increase TVL and returns. Increasing TVL is critical to scale volumes, since DHV is currently at very high utilization (~60%-80% average utilization in September), and considering the incentives planned on the trading side it is safe to assume that higher TVL will be needed to support volume growth.\n\nBelow an analysis on the expected impact of the grants:\n\nScreenshot 2023-10-05 at 00.17.37\nScreenshot 2023-10-05 at 00.17.37\n1668×978 48.2 KB\nWe expect the TVL to go around $3m since this will generate an additional ~0.47% returns on a weekly basis (assuming current ARB/USD price). On the trading side the target is 3k contracts traded per week, that will distribute an incentive of ~$4.69 (assuming current ARB/USD price) per contract traded, an incentive strong enough to rebate fees and enter trades that reduce the risk exposure of the pool.\n\nKey Performance Indicators (KPIs):\n\nMonthly Volumes\nNew users\nReturning users (retention)\nTVL\nHow will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem?:\n\nSince the Beyond launch, Rysk has positioned itself as one of the top three options protocols by volumes. On average, since launch it accounts for over 5% of the total volumes in the space.\n\nScreenshot 2023-09-19 at 00.16.10\nScreenshot 2023-09-19 at 00.16.10\n2350×952 165 KB\nRysk volumes are primarily driven by returning users who consistently trade with a low churn rate. Current Rysk traders commonly provide feedback that they all enjoy the Rysk trading experience.\n\nScreenshot 2023-09-19 at 00.18.49\nScreenshot 2023-09-19 at 00.18.49\n3388×1538 312 KB\nThe main challenge for Rysk at this stage is to increase awareness of Rysk and encourage user participation in the protocol. Grants could have a significant impact on achieving this goal for the following reasons:\n\n1. Traders\nCurrently, one of the main challenges for Rysk is the low volatility environment, which makes options selling unattractive to traders. The DHV acts as a market maker, and maintaining a balanced flow between buyers and sellers is crucial for the success and sustainability of the protocol. Traders will receive incentives based on volumes and their impact in reducing the DHV book exposure to risky instruments that can cause losses for Liquidity Providers. By achieving a more balanced flow, the Rysk mechanism becomes healthier, benefiting the entire Arbitrum ecosystem with a liquid and sustainable on-chain options DEX.\n\nIn addition to Rysk Beyond DHV, the protocol is relatively new, and the goal of this grant is to increase the awareness of Rysk and attract new options traders. Arbitrum is currently the primary derivative chain, and we believe that options have significant growth potential. This grant will be used to position Rysk as one of the main options protocols and strengthen Arbitrum as the derivative chain.\n\n2. Liquidity Providers\nOne of the current limitations of the Rysk protocol is the lack of liquidity. This is due to low TVL and low capital efficiency, resulting in limited trading volumes. To address this issue, the grants will be utilized to focus on increasing liquidity. Simultaneously, the team will continue researching and implementing optimizations to improve capital efficiency in order to be competitive with CEXs. Additionally, efforts will be made to improve options pricing and advance risk management.\n\nJustification for the size of the grant:\n\nRysk is an OG Arbitrum native. Rysk Alpha was launched in September 2022, over a year ago, and has not been deployed to other chains since then. Since the launch, we have also developed integrations to trade on-chain with other Arbitrum native protocols such as GMX and Rage Trade, and we are actively seeking to integrate with more protocols.\n\nRysk has always been highly active in the Arbitrum community. For example, we organized a trading competition in partnership with Gammaswap, an Arbitrum Native protocol. The competition was sponsored by various main Arbitrum protocols, including GMX, JonesDao, Dopex, Radiant, Across, Perennial, Mux, Factor, Rage Trade, Umami, and Vela, with the aim of engaging the entire community.\n\nIn addition, we believe that a decentralized options market with deep liquidity and high performance is critical in any financial system. Rysk is currently focused on providing a competitive, innovative, and composable options venue in the Arbitrum Ecosystem. This venue can be used by traders, sophisticated institutions, and other protocols to hedge, speculate, or build complex options strategies.\n\nIt is clear that the DeFi options market is a very challenging industry. This is due to the complexity of options by design, technical product limitations (such as capital requirements), and the current market conditions with low volatility. We are working hard to improve the protocol, educate users, and collaboratively build the entire DeFi options industry together with teams and communities in the space.\n\nThe growth potential of DeFi options is massive, especially if institutional players enter the space. Our final goal is to position Rysk and Arbitrum as the go-to place for trading options as DeFi matures and the options market takes off.\n\nIt’s worth noting that as of today, Rysk has never received a grant from Arbitrum or any other chain.\n\nIn conclusion, the grant size reflects Rysk’s status as an OG Arbitrum protocol, native to Arbitrum, integrated within its ecosystem with a collaborative approach. The grant size also considers the challenges of the DeFi options market, the potential for growth, and the significant impact that grants can have on expanding the options space. This grant aims to provide Rysk and Arbitrum with a competitive advantage.\n\nExecution Strategy:\n\nGrants will be distribute as follow:\n\n1. Traders\nRysk traders will be eligible on a weekly basis for a share of ARB as a function of the volumes traded and the impact of the trades to reduce the DHV exposure and risk.\n\nThe amount distributed per contract will be capped to avoid wash trading. The cap will be different on each trade and will be a function of bid-ask spread, fees, the exposure of the series, position held, the time the position is held and type of trade (sell or buy).\n\n2. Liquidity Providers\nRysk DHV depositors will be eligible on a weekly basis for a share of ARB based on their capital proportion in the pool.\n\nGrant Timeline: Funds will be distributed until Jan 31st 2024 on a weekly basis, starting after the first stream is received.\n\nDo you accept the funding of your grant streamed linearly for the duration of your grant proposal, and that the multisig holds the power to halt your stream?

Additional improvements are currently in the research phase. These improvements aim to provide better collateralization for sellers in order to increase liquidity and achieve a more balanced trading flow.\n\nThe team is currently researching ways to enhance the protocol’s performance, such as improving hedging and trade execution. New improvements and products that focus on this area are scheduled to be launched in Q1 2024.\n\nAudit History:\n\nTrust - Beyond Upgrade - June 2023\nTrust x 100Proof - Beyond - February 2023\nDedaub - Beyond - January 2023\nTrust - range order - December 2022\nDedaub - GMX- December 2022\nDedaub - Alpha - June 2022\nAkiraTech - Alpha - August 2022\nAll reports can be found on Security Reviews - Rysk Finance 2\n\nSECTION 5: Data and Reporting\nProvide details on how your team is equipped to provide data and reporting on grant distribution.\n\nIs your team prepared to create Dune Dashboards for your incentive program?: Yes.

We aim to provide low-risk, high-sharpe ratio strategies in easy to understand packaged products and exposure profiles, helping to onboard users into the ecosystem as well as bolster the liquidity on the network.\n\nTeam Members and Qualifications:\n\n0xWenmoon: Treasury Manager & Lead Business Development\nToki: Lead Smart Contract Engineer\nStevenT: Market & Liquidity Strategist\nEdis: Social Media & Marketing\nOxDapper: Smart Contract Engineer\nGreypixel: Lead Frontend Developer\nClonesCody: Fullstack Developer\nProject Links:\n\nWebsite 37\nGitHub 2\nTwitter 15\nContact Information:\n\nTelegram: @StevenTab\nTwitter: NeoTokyoCat 7\nEmail: Neotokyocat@gmail.com\nKYC Acknowledgement: Yes\n\nSECTION 2: GRANT INFORMATION\nRequested Grant Size: 750,000 ARB\n\nGrant Matching: N/A\n\nGrant Breakdown:\n\nGLP Vault Incentives: 750,000 ARB\nVesting Distribution: ~187,500 ARB/Month\nVesting Period: Incentives will be distributed evenly from the day they are granted to the end of the short-term incentives program, 31st January 2024.\nThe incentivisation mechanism we plan to use takes inspiration from Dolomite’s oARB mechanism in their Forum Proposal, with minor changes being made to better fit our protocol. We find this method of incentivisation best protects Arbitrum from instant dumping of rewards, and instead favors longer term incentive alignment for liquidity farmers, creating a better outcome for both Umami and Arbitrum.\n\nUsers can stake their Umami vault receipt tokens for oARB emissions.\noARB is continuously emitted and can be vested on a first-come, first-serve basis.\nWe will use a simple MasterChef or Gauge contract for the emissions\noARB that’s emitted can be staked for x duration (in increments of 1 week up to 4 months) and must be paired with the same amount of ARB (1:1 ratio).\nFor example, vesting 100 oARB requires you pair it with 100 ARB in the contract\nWe’ll represent each stake a user takes as unique NFT locks so popular DeFi dashboards can track them\nAfter the vesting period, the underlying ARB can be obtained for a y% discount to the oracle price\nThe discount will depend on how long the oARB is locked for and will be linear from 1 week to 16 weeks with each additional week adding 2.5% to the discount. This is subject to change pending feedback.\n1-week is a 2.5% discount\n2-weeks is 5% discount\n…\n15-weeks is 37.5% discount\n16-weeks is 40% discount\nAs demonstrated with this discount schedule, staking to achieve the max discount requires users hold the paired ARB for longer, a positive result for the Arbitrum ecosystem as users have their interests aligned for longer.\nThe price will be determined via Chainlink oracle at the time of purchase\nThis guarantees fair pricing and that farmers will make money when they execute the options.\nKeep in mind, oARB must be paired with ARB on a 1:1 basis to begin vesting. This should help offset ARB sell pressure and constrain users from vesting oARB too quickly if they accumulate a large amount (similar to esGMX and GMX vesting). It also helps align incentives of farmers with Arbtirum\nIf the ARB rewards pool is depleted, all remaining oARB tokens expire worthless\nStaked ARB (that’s paired with oARB) will be deposited in Dolomite to improve capital efficiency for farmers\nWe want to avoid giving the tokens away for free since it encourages dumping at the expense of ARB in exchange for boosting Umami’s TVL. That would be a bad outcome for Arbitrum, and we would rather be positive sum for the ecosystem!\nUsers will receive their exercised oARB as ARB tokens in their wallet\nHow lucrative is this for farmers?\nSuppose we emit $333k worth of ARB over 2 months ($2M annualized). The max discount is 40%, which means $800k worth of annualized value is emitted\nIf Umami gets $10M in TVL to stake (more than doubling our current TVL), the max reward APR would be 8% - why?\n$2M annualized * 40% discount = $800k in value delivered to farmers.\n$800k / $10M = 8%\nNote: this program will be even more lucrative when staked deposits are lower, encouraging more yield farmers to participate\nFunding Address: 0x8E52cA5A7a9249431F03d60D79DDA5EAB4930178\n\nFunding Address Characteristics: 3/6 multisig controlled by Umami DAO team. This is the multisig used for our current ARB airdrop allocation.\n\nContract Address: 0x8E52cA5A7a9249431F03d60D79DDA5EAB4930178\n\nSECTION 3: GRANT OBJECTIVES AND EXECUTION\nObjectives:\n\nIncrease Arbitrum and Umami user base by leveraging partnerships with other Arbitrum projects to cross-promote.\nImprove Umami Vaults’ TVL efficiency by incentivizing equal TVL distribution between vaults.\nIncrease liquidity for GMX traders by incentivizing further deposits into Umami’s GLP vaults\nBoost vault performance and yields, including real yields through more internal netting thanks to more deposits.\nEducate users on Umami product offerings by leveraging social media for maximum reach.\nKPIs:\n\nTVL growth - 10M TVL by end of January (250% increase)\nUser growth and retention (Analytics page)\nVault APR performance (Measure internal netting efficiencies due to incentives)\nInnovation and Growth:\nThe grant will amplify our vaults’ yields and draw attention to both Umami and Arbitrum as the home of the highest single asset exposure yields in DeFi… Umami is a highly symbiotic protocol; as well as offering the clearest view on the actual performance of GMX’s GLP, increasing vault TVL is mutually beneficial to GMX and the Arbitrum ecosystem: as users come to appreciate the benefits of our vaults all parties will see a healthy increase in the coveted ""sticky TVL”.\n\nLooking ahead, the credibility that Umami has garnered from the overwhelming technical success of the GLP vaults puts the protocol in excellent standing for the upcoming launch of its GMX v2 vaults. We believe these vaults will offer an incredibly compelling value proposition for prospective GMX v2 LPs seeking a simpler and easier to track alternative to the perhaps overwhelming choice of depositing into GMX v2 directly.\n\nJustification for Grant Size:\nUmami has shown consistent innovation since its October 2021 inception and has evolved from Olympus DAO-like tokenomics to generating real revenue through our products. As an OG project with over $4m TVL, Umami is leading Arbitrum in real yield ETH, USDC and wBTC products. The proposed grant size is in line with the grant guidelines for a project of our TVL and OG status. The grant will help bring more liquidity to GMX and bring more “real yield” to arbitrum. Umami offers the best risk-adjusted returns in real yield for any of the provided assets on any chain and the grant would help highlight this and attract new users to Arbitrum as a result.\n\nExecution Strategy\n\nResources and Products: Our team comprises experts in Solidity, Frontend and Webstack Development, Market and Liquidity Strategy, Treasury Management, and Social Media Marketing. We are prepared to allocate these resources effectively to fulfill the objectives set out in this grant proposal.\n\nUse of Funds: The 750,000 ARB will be wholly allocated to incentivize our GLP vaults on Arbitrum. This is aimed at bringing more users to both the Arbitrum ecosystem and our innovative Umami vaults.\n\nIncentive Allocation: Our aim is to strategically weigh incentives to maximize total value locked (TVL), thereby optimizing internal netting performance. To start we will target:\n\n40% to glpUSDCb\n\n30% to glpETHb\n\n28% to glpBTCb\n\n1% to glpLINKb\n\n1% to glpUNIb\n\nThis allocation is informed by current demands and liquidity trends on the Arbitrum network, as well as our overarching strategy of balanced risk and diversified yield.\n\nAdaptive Weight Adjustments: As we analyze the responsiveness of the market to these incentives, we will be ready to adjust the weights to optimize deposits where they are most needed, thereby refining our APY and attracting a broader set of users.\n\nRisk Management: To mitigate risks associated with smart contracts and fund management, we will rely on contracts with already comprehensive third-party audits. These tested and proven contracts for token emissions and reward distribution will allow us to regularly update our community on progress and any changes through transparent reporting.\n\nPerformance Metrics: KPIs will be monitored closely to ensure that our strategy is yielding the desired results. This will include TVL, incentives per vault/% of total distributed, user growth, individual vault performance.\n\nOperational Milestones: We will adhere to the grant timeline, which involves multiple phases such as auditing, internal testing, and public releases of new products or versions.\n\nBy executing this strategy, we aim to foster increased adoption, innovation, and liquidity in both Umami’s products and the broader Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nGrant Timeline\n\nThe ARB will be distributed within 2 weeks of receipt. The incentives will be distributed within 16 weeks.\nFunding Terms Acceptance: Yes\n\nSECTION 4: PROTOCOL DETAILS\nIs the Protocol Native to Arbitrum?

The program would run from November 1, 2023 - January 31, 2024.\n\nThe program would distribute 250,000 ARB monthly for three months to liquidity providers who participate in qualified Gamma vaults built on top of liquidity pools of our six currently supported AMMs.\n\nSince we have already deployed on Arbitrum and our partner AMMs, we would not require any development funds for this grant. 100% will be going to LPs.\n\nFunding Address:\n\n0x8beFf353FCb2E288fdFFbb0b2B61B4c76dc700Df 10- Gamma Community Treasury Arbitrum\n\nFunding Address Characteristics:\n\n2/3 GnosisSafe multisig with stored keys. Link 8.\n\nContract Address:\n\nGamma will deploy specific rewarder contracts (example 4) for each AMM to properly disperse funds. Rewarder contracts will be posted here 6 in our Contracts Repository.\n\nSECTION 3: GRANT OBJECTIVES AND EXECUTION\nObjectives:\n\nOur objective is to deploy liquidity incentives on three native AMMs (Ramses, Camelot, and Zyberswap) and two non-native AMMs (Uniswap, SushiSwap, and Pancakeswap), to increase liquidity on the Arbitrum network.\n\nCompared to other grant proposals, our priority is to find unbiased, undercapitalized pools on the Arbitrum network.\n\nKey Performance Indicators (KPIs):\n\nTotal Value Locked (TVL) - Evaluating the amount of liquidity that has entered the liquidity pools via Gamma’s vaults\nVolume Through Vaults (VTV) - Evaluating the amount of volume that Gamma vaults have facilitated\n𐤃 Volume - Evaluate the change in volume in the pool prior to incentivizing Gamma vaults\nSlippage - Measuring slippage on a variety of hypothetical trades.\nEfficiency - Evaluate the actions of DEX aggregators toward incentivized pools\nTVL / Volume - Evaluating the capital efficiency of each pool by understanding the volume to TVL ratio.\nLP Performance - Evaluating the performance of LPs from fixed points in time. These include Gamma vault vs hold, hold 100% token0, and hold 100% token1.\nHow will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem?:\n\nLiquidity incentives are critical to bootstrapping and building healthy decentralized liquidity pools on a growing blockchain. Correctly allocated and managed concentrated liquidity pools allow low slippage trading, which is vital to a healthy network.\n\nGamma receiving this grant creates long-term ideal liquidity conditions for liquidity providers, traders, and our partner AMMs. Gamma also has the incentive to find undercapitalized pools that “fill the gaps” between proposals from exchanges or other liquidity mangers.\n\nJustification for the size of the grant:\n\nGamma passes all the metrics for a Siren grant.\n\nGamma has invested significant resources to integrate natively with many of the major DEXs on Arbitrum, including Uniswap, Zyberswap, Ramses, Camelot, Pandcakeswap, and SushiSwap.\n\nMany of these integrations were bespoke integrations that involved integration with not only their smart contracts (UniswapV3Pool.sol, AlgebraPool.sol v1.0, AlgebraPool.sol v1.9, AlgebraPool.sol v2.0, and RamsesV2Pool.sol) but with each DEX’s unique rewarder infrastructure including the Angle Merkl rewarder for Uniswap and Sushi, MultiFeeDistribution contract for Ramses, and Camelot’s spNFT liquidity locking contract.\n\nWe’ve spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on blue-chip audits with ConsenSys Diligence for our main position manager smart contracts, and we have a prepaid two-week/two-person audit with OpenZeppelin specifically for our hedging vaults that will integrate natively with GMX v2 on Arbitrum to hedge against impermanent loss on our positions.\n\nAdditionally, we are running four servers to handle the data infrastructure and two dedicated servers to handle the automation of these positions. We’re also subscribed to the highest-tier RPC plans to handle the load on Arbitrum where we average well over 1.8 million RPC requests daily. We are also subscribed to the enterprise plan for OpenZeppelin Defender, which provides the execution layer for both our LP positions and our hedging strategies.\n\nWe were also active proponents of supporting Arbitrum liquidity in Uniswap’s governance forum. We authored a Uniswap governance proposal to utilize Uniswap’s $ARB DAO airdrop to support liquidity on Arbitrum. This proposal garnered significant support amongst Uniswap delegates, with 50.03M in support of the proposal with only 5.52M opposed.\n\nGamma is currently integrating a sixth AMM, Pancakeswap, and they will be included in the program.\n\nExecution Strategy:\n\nIf funds are awarded to Gamma, we will immediately begin talks with our partner AMMs on identifying appropriate pools to incentivize.\n\nNot listing the pools here is not an attempt to be purposely ambiguous, but more to have flexibility about how we’re going to be distributing incentives. In our experience, these kinds of choices are made with the most possible information, closer to game time.\n\nGamma will take into account pairs that are already being incentivized and search for under-capitalized pools based on our analysis of trading activity on the Arbitrum network.\n\nOur methodology on choosing pairs comes down to the following factors:.\n\nNative pairs to Arbitrum (these pairs tend to need the most liquidity and are undercapitalized)\nCritical infrastructure pairs (WETH, ARB, WBTC, stablecoins, and most users regularly use)\nPairs that play to the strengths of the AMM they’re on.\nAvoiding already incentivized pairs by another organization\nAvoiding overcapitalized pairs\nStructuring incentives so AMMs are not working against each other inefficiently\nGrant Timeline:\n\n-Application/Review/Voting: October 11, 2023\n-Grant Administration / KYC Period: Late October 2023\n-Pool Identification and Deployment Period: Late October 2023\n-Incentive Program Begins (with biweekly updates): November 1, 2023\n-Incentive Program Ends: January 31, 2024\n-Final Report: February 15, 2024\n\nTime	ARB per Period	Cumulative ARB\nNovember 2023	250,000	250,000\nDecember 2023	250,000	500,000\nJanuary 2024	250,000	750,000\nTOTAL	750,000.00	\nDo you accept the funding of your grant streamed linearly for the duration of your grant proposal, and that the multisig holds the power to halt your stream?\n\nYes\n\nSECTION 4: PROTOCOL DETAILS\nIs the Protocol Native to Arbitrum?:\n\nNo, Gamma currently supports fourteen different networks, including Arbitrum.\n\nOn what other networks is the protocol deployed?:\n\nEthereum Mainnet, Optimism, Polygon Proof-of-Stake, Polygon zkEVM, BNB Chain, Base, Moonbeam, Linea, Mantle, Rollux, Celo, Avalanche, Fantom.\n\nWhat date did you deploy on Arbitrum?:\n\nNovember 1st, 2022 (324 days ago)\n\nProtocol Performance:\n\n\n1504×733 62.7 KB\nAs of September 21st, 2023, Gamma currently has $6.2m in TVL on Arbitrum. Gamma’s TVL 5 peaked on Arbitrum on April 1st, 2023, with approximately $19.1m in TVL. After a period of decline, Gamma was able to onboard several new partners to bolster our Arbitrum participation.\n\nGamma supports five different AMMs on Arbitrum and is adding a sixth (Pancakeswap). Uniswap, SushiSwap, Zyberswap 1, Ramses, and Camelot. All these AMMs currently have frontend support on Gamma’s application and have already established liquidity incentive programs with Gamma.\n\n\n1600×1570 312 KB\n\nGamma currently manages over all networks about $80m in funds on fourteen networks and seventeen AMMs. We have a diverse management portfolio of volatile and stable assets. We are a leader in our space in fees and revenue produced, AMM/network integrations, supported pools, and Arbitrum TVL,\n\n1429×895 76.5 KB\n\nGamma is currently at a sustainable operations level where we are making enough protocol revenue 6 to fund operations indefinitely. We can confidently continue operations through the life of the grant cycle.\nProtocol Roadmap:\n\nGamma is currently in the process of deploying hedging strategies on Arbitrum using GMX. These new strategies will be deployable in Gamma’s vaults on our partner’s liquidity pools. The hedging strategy code is being audited by OpenZeppelin 1.\n\nOnce these new strategies are ready, we plan to migrate some of the incentives to the advanced vaults for liquidity providers to take advantage of.\n\nAudit History:\n\nGamma has major audits from Arbitrary Execution and ConsenSys Diligence. As mentioned previously, our hedging strategies will be audited by OpenZeppelin 1.\n\nSECTION 5: Data and Reporting\nIs your team prepared to create Dune Dashboards for your incentive program?:\n\nYes.\n\nDoes your team agree to provide bi-weekly program updates on the Arbitrum Forum thread?\n\nYes. Gamma can provide bi-weekly updates on vaults, TVL, performance, and incentive distribution.\n\nDoes your team acknowledge that failure to comply with any of the above requests can result in the halting of the program’s funding stream?:\n\nYes.",Short Term Incentive Program

This means users can personally control their risk exposure and conduct safe lending practices.\nLending Markets for All Tokens: By design, Silo Finance can create lending markets for any token assets. Our commitment to this goal is evident in our support for tokens such as $rDPX, $JONES, and $PREMIA etc. that are not available elsewhere.\nAttracting TVL: Lending markets in themselves drive capital efficiency by giving users access to liquidity without losing exposure to their tokens. By incentivizing TVL on Silo Finance, we aim to drive deep lending liquidity that will contribute to the growth of Arbitrum TVL and its user base.\nJustification for the size of the grant:\nSilo Finance was the first lending protocol to launch a lending market for the $ARB token. To date, the SiloDAO has streamed over 1M $SILO (> ~$65,000 then) to the $ARB lending market, building the deepest isolated lending market for the token with $6M TVL across $ARB/$ETH/$USDC.e.\n\nThe $SILO incentive program covers other isolated lending markets such as GMX, DPX, wstETH, and rETH. This program is financed by SiloDAO and has contributed significantly to creating deep lending markets that see consistent utilization of deposited funds.\n\n1M $ARB will allow us to scale lending both horizontally and vertically by creating new lending markets as well as increasing activities in existing ones.\n\nExecution Strategy:\n100% allocated to incentivizing deposit/borrow actions in 16 isolated lending markets that meet the following criteria:\n\nResilient oracles for all underlying assets in the market\nSufficient DEX liquidity\nRead the distribution framework here 43.\n\nWe will stream bi-weekly incentives to users depositing/borrowing passively.\n\nAny $ARB that is not distributed will be returned to the Arbitrum Foundation.\n\nGrant Timeline:\nWe plan to distribute the incentives linearly over 3.5 months period, starting October 15, 2023 and ending January 31, 2024.\n\nDo you accept the funding of your grant streamed linearly for the duration of your grant proposal, and that the multisig holds the power to halt your stream?\nYes\n\nSECTION 4: PROTOCOL DETAILS\nProvide details about the Arbitrum protocol requirements relevant to the grant. This information ensures that the applicant is aligned with the technical specifications and commitments of the grant.\n\nIs the Protocol Native to Arbitrum?:\nSilo Finance was initially launched on Ethereum Mainnet. SiloDAO is set to launch Silo V2 on Arbitrum first to become an Arbitrum native protocol.\n\nOn what other networks is the protocol deployed?:\nEthereum\n\nWhat date did you deploy on Arbitrum?: [Date of deployment]\n8 February 2023\n\nProtocol Performance:\n\n1600×1112 198 KB\nSilo v1.1 was launched in August 2022 on Ethereum Mainnet and has a secondary mainnet deployment known as Silo Llama as well as Silo Arbitrum. Our total TVL across all markets is $98m with $15.3m TVL on Arbitrum alone.\n\nSince our deployment on Arbitrum, we have grown to be the largest risk-isolated lending market for $ARB with $6.4m TVL. Additionally, we have supported the launch of lending markets for Arbitrum-native tokens such as $MAGIC, $Y2K, $JONES, and $PREMIA which are not available on other platforms.\n\nWe have integrated lending market support for Curve LP tokens on Silo Ethereum and believe Arbitrum is home to a broad range of composable products where similar integrations would be suitable - this could include markets for GMX and Camelot LP tokens. Silo has also been used as the base layer lending market for other Arbitrum protocols including FactorDAO and Nitro Cartel.\n\nSilo currently runs a co-incentive program on Silo Arbitrum where we match incentives from partner protocols such as Dopex, GMX, and Gainstrade. Incentives have played a key part in the success of our Arbitrum deployment and we believe a grant will allow us to drive deep lending liquidity and capital efficiency for the ecosystem as a whole.\n\nProtocol Roadmap:\nSilo V2 is an upcoming upgrade to the Silo protocol scheduled for Q4 with plans to deploy on Arbitrum first. It is a reconceptualization of the original Silo design that will maintain our risk-isolated architecture while supporting a more extensive variety of tokens and significantly improving capital efficiency. It also includes a veSILO tokenomics upgrade allowing locked $SILO to vote for $SILO emissions gauges on Arbitrum.\n\nWe regularly release new markets for tokens and are proud to say we are the only protocol that has a market for $rDPX, $rETH, $GNS, $JONES, $PREMIA, and $Y2K. As the Arbitrum ecosystem grows, we will happily extend support for all suitable tokens.\n\nAudit History:\nSilo v1.1 Smart Contract Audit (ABDK)\nSilo v1.1 Smart Contract Audit (Quantstamp)\nSilo Curve Convex Token Market Smart Contract Audit (Chainsecurity)\nSilo v1.1 Formal Verification Testing (Certora)\nChainlink Price Provider Formal Verification Testing (Certora)\n\ndevdocs.silo.finance\nAudits & Formal Verification 2\nSECTION 5: Data and Reporting\nProvide details on how your team is equipped to provide data and reporting on grant distribution.\n\nIs your team prepared to create Dune Spells and/or Dashboards for your incentive program?:\nYes\n\nDoes your team agree to provide bi-weekly program updates on the Arbitrum Forum thread?\nSilo Finance will report on the following aspects:\n\nQuantitative: Creating a custom dashboard to track incentives distribution and impact on stated success metrics;\nQualitative: Describing any change in distribution methodology for optimization purposes and the results of such changes.\nDoes your team acknowledge that failure to comply with any of the above requests can result in the halting of the program’s funding stream?:\nYes",Short Term Incentive Program
https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/socket-final-stip-round-1/17342,"SECTION 1: APPLICANT INFORMATION\nApplicant Name: Sriram Vasudevan\n\nProject Name: Socket Protocol\n\nProject Description: Socket is an interoperability protocol for building cross-chain use cases & apps. Socket offers the most efficient way to transfer liquidity across chains by tapping into all available liquidity sources.\n\nSocket has facilitated over $4B+ in volumes across chains and over $1B+ in volumes into Arbitrum since launch.\n\nTeam Members and Qualifications:\n\nVaibhav Chellani 13 (Cofounder & CEO): First developer at Polygon; built first ever zkRollup & most scalable Optimistic rollup; Early core contributor at Flashbots.\nRishabh Khurana 5 (Cofounder): 4+yrs of experience launching web2 products (scaled one from 0 to $40mn ARR at India’s first Unicorn).\nArth Patel 1 (Head of Engineering): Early developer at Polygon, built Polygon PoS bridge, ex-developer at Union Protcol, advisor & fren to DeFi projects\nLito Coen 4 (Growth): Founder of a crypto education platform since 2018, built community at Hop Protocol\nProject links:\n\nWebsite: https://socket.tech/ 123\nDocs: https://docs.socket.tech/ 7\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/SocketDotTech 26\nGithub: Socket · GitHub 5\nContact Information:\n\nTG: @vaibhavchellani\n\nTG: @khuranarishabh\n\nEmail: rishabh@socket.tech\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/vaibhavchellani 13\n\nDo You Acknowledge That Your Team Will Be Subject to a KYC Requirement?: Yes\n\nSECTION 2: GRANT INFORMATION\nRequested Grant Size: 1,000,000 ARB\n\nGrant Matching:\n\nSocket doesn’t have a token and hence can’t match with token co-incentives. However, we plan to allocate significant marketing efforts & resources to our partners to attract users & liquidity. To achieve these we will be conducting marketing campaigns, tutorials, guides & more!\n\nWe also plan to allocate significant developer efforts & resources to help our partners build great onboarding experiences along with 24/7 user & developer support.\n\nLastly, we will continue to educate users & community about bridging through initiatives like our Bridge Risk Framework 1 13, which we launched in collaboration with L2Beat.\n\nGrant Breakdown\n\nWe think of Arbitrum as an ecosystem of chains including Arbitrum One, Arbitrum Nova & upcoming Arbitrum Orbit chains. With an increasing number of L2s and L3s, the problem of liquidity fragmentation & bridging only increases in size.\n\nThe purpose of this grant is to fight the increasing fragmentation & unlock seamless flow of liquidity into the Arbitrum ecosystem. We will use the allocated tokens to achieve this by:\n\nWorking with 80+ partner ecosystems to subsidize onboarding costs for users onboarding onto Arbitrum One ecosystem\nEncouraging developers to build unique cross-chain use cases that bring TVL into Arbitrum ecosystem. More on these use cases below\nIncentivizing the adoption of Socket’s SuperBridge allowing users to easily transfer liquidity from other L2’s into Orbit app chains\nFunding Address: 0x952aB7dd815558511bc80A3532D89368130F0809\n\nFunding Address Characteristics: Multi-sig\n\nContract Address: N/A\n\nSECTION 3: GRANT OBJECTIVES AND EXECUTION\nObjectives\n\nThe primary objective of the grant is to work with Arbitrum ecosystem & attract liquidity/TVL into Arbitrum One, Arbitrum L3s and more.\n\nWe intend to bring a seamless bridging of liquidity through Socket ecosystem that has access to over 50M wallets via top web3 wallets like Metamask, Coinbase Wallet and apps including GMX, Zapper, Zerion, Layer3, Jones DAO, Lyra & more!\n\nHere are key use cases that the grant will help us push with current & future partners:\n\nOffering subsidized bridging for users bridging to Arbitrum. This includes projects like Metamask, Coinbase Wallet, Rainbow Wallet, Bungee Exchange, XDEFI, Slingshot, Layer3, Zapper, Zerion & more\nCreate chain agnostic onboarding experience into Arbitrum which allows users on Polygon/Optimism etc. to directly onboard into Arbitrum apps in 1 click (no bridging, swapping, switching RPCs or even needing GAS on Arbitrum)\nWork with Arbitrum Orbit chains to allow users to bridge funds into the chains at NO COST. Our unique approach allows this with 0 bridge fees, 0 slippage, and no liquidity pools. This is already live with Aevo & going live with Arbitrum Orbit chains soon.\nExpand tokens native to other chains to Arbitrum while retaining complete ownership of the token. This is based on Sovereign Token Standard- allowing token issuers to securely expand to Arbitrum with no bridge lock-in.\nAll of the above use cases not only help bring native TVL into the Arbitrum ecosystem but also help increase significant transaction activity for Arbitrum ecosystem apps.\n\nKey Performance Indicators (KPIs):\n\nWe will use the following KPI’s to track the success of our grant:\n\nCross-chain TVL migrated to Arbitrum\nTotal volume & users bridged into Arbitrum\nNumber of first-time users bridging to Arbitrum\nHow will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem?\n\nThere are 4 major ways we foster growth and innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem:\n\nBetter UX in Arbitrum Native Applications: The typical user journey of a user on Polygon who wants to deploy on Arbitrum app is 40+ clicks and 10+ tabs. We work with apps to reduce it to a single transaction & click. The grant will encourage the usage on these apps & encourage more apps to adopt such innovative UX drive features\nNative bridging to Arbitrum in wallets: A year back no wallet allowed users to bridge to Arbitrum natively in the wallet. Socket has expanded this coverage by working with top wallets. The grant will encourage the usage & discovery of bridging features on these wallets and encourage more wallets to add native bridging into Arbitrum\nBootstrap Arbitrum Orbit chains: Users directly want to jump into L3s directly from other L2s without multiple hoops like L2 → Arbitrum → L3. Liquidity bridges do not scale for such use cases because of issues like extensive liquidity bootstrapping. We offer a unique solution that allows users to bridge into L3s from any chain without any liquidity pools or bridge fee\nExpansion of non-Arbitrum native apps to Arbitrum: Today a protocol with token on BSC has no way to expand to Arbitrum without locking the token into the specific bridge.

Our main goal is to build an alternative for CEX option markets on-chain while leveraging the composability of defi to build new option primitives. In addition, we will turn the ARB token into a productive asset, some examples are: create arb options markets, margin trading for major assets such as BTC and ETH.\n\nThis grant would act as Nitro fuel to bootstrap and solidify the new Dopex option architecture we are building with our V2 ecosystem. RDPX can be bonded to get receipt tokens that represent ETH:DPXETH LPs in a curve pool. This receipt token can be used in our upcoming CLAMM and Option Pools with deep liquidity, instant settlements and a range of option markets for blue chip tokens such as BTC, ETH and ARB as well.\n\nUsers who bond their RDPX will help strengthen the protocol liquidity and get rewarded by it with these extra ARB incentives. Same goes for users who LP in our Perpetual Puts and CLAMM LPs.\n\nJustification for the size of the grant:\nThe 1.5M ARB tokens will be distributed on a 3 month vesting period and will be used to jumpstart defi options activity, increase TVL, engage with DAOS that are willing to delegate into the RDPXV2 bonding system. All this fuel will increase paid on-chain fees therefore bringing in more revenue for the Arb DAO via sequencer fees.\n\nExecution Strategy:\nFunds will be used in the following programs:\n\nRDPX V2 Receipt tokens stakers\nRDPX V2 Perpetual put vault deposits\nDopex V2 CLAMM LPs\nRDPX V2 Receipt tokens stakers:\n\nUsers deposit their receipt tokens into the staking contract and receive the additional arb rewards every 2 weeks based on TVL and staking time\n\nArb amount: 675,000(45% of the grant)\nMonthly distribution: 225,000 per month\nRDPX V2 Perpetual put vault deposits:\n\nLPs will lock their assets and receive arb rewards based on % share deposited for perp put vault\n\nArb amount: 225,000(15% of the grant)\nMonthly distribution: 75,000 per month\nDopex V2 CLAMM LPs:\n\nUsers deposit their CLAMM LPS with us and earn additional ARB rewards based on the TVL/time LPs are locked.\n\nArb amount: 600,000(40% of the grant)\nMonthly distribution: 200,000 per month\nThe following pools will be incentivized:\n\nETH/USDC\nARB/USDC\nDPX/ETH\nFunds will be hold and distributed on the following ⅔ multisig address: 0x880C3cdCA73254D466f9c716248339dE88e4a97D 16\n\nGrant Timeline: [Describe the timeline for the grant]\nBased on the distribution schedule, the grant will be distributed in total within 3 months.

This grant will help to enhance and deepen spot liquidity, allowing Trader Joe to offer a more stable and efficient exchange experience that directly benefits the builders whom the markets support. Since its expansion to the Arbitrum network, Trader Joe has already enhanced liquidity for several key Arbitrum protocols. This has been achieved through sustainable reward distributions from its bespoke Market Maker incentive program, utilizing its custom-designed Automated Market Maker (AMM) known as Liquidity Book.\n\n2) Signal Growth\nThe Arbitrum DAO prides itself as a neutral and open governing body, upholding the values of interoperation and open innovation. As such, Trader Joe plans to use this grant to support both long-standing and newly launched protocols native to Arbitrum One but also those who have deployed to Arbitrum One. Trader Joe believes that by supporting multi-chain protocols that have shown commitment towards Arbitrum, this will signal to the wider DeFi landscape that Arbitrum can be a home to builders who have yet to deploy here. With this grant, Trader Joe will aim to directly bolster Arbitrum’s standing as the go-to Layer 2 platform for innovation in the DeFi space.\n\n3) Grow the Arbitrum User Base\nTrader Joe aims to leverage the incentives granted to attract a larger and more diverse user base to the Arbitrum ecosystem. Utilizing its unique multi-chain position alongside previously delivered growth campaigns, Trader Joe will amplify the network effects of the allocated grant incentives via an Arbitrum Adventure branded Marketing Campaign. This approach will see resources committed from the Trader Joe ecosystem to raise awareness with the aim of creating a ripple effect that drives user acquisition for the Arbitrum Ecosystem. The phased approach to incentivization outlined in the below execution strategy, will complement the efforts of new user acquisition as Marketing efforts will be timed with each phase transition. The goal is to champion Arbitrum as a vibrant hub ripe with activity, benefiting all participants within the ecosystem.\n\nJustification for the size of the grant:\nTrader Joe has built a reputable and trusted name in the space through a commitment to long-lasting, collaborative relationships and a community-first approach. In addition, Trader Joe has a track record of continuous product innovation and has maintained high safety and security standards. Since deploying to Arbitrum, Trader Joe has signaled a significant level of commitment to the ecosystem by not only fostering a great trading and liquidity experience, but also launching community focused efforts 6 to grow Arbitrum with continued community campaigns to be launched and aligned with the Arbitrum Odyssey 2.\n\nTrader Joe offers a unique DEX experience on Arbitrum with its custom AMM, Liquidity Book. This novel primitive discretizes liquidity, enabling on-chain zero slippage trade execution and surge pricing for liquidity providers. It also offers a granular, hyper-manageable liquidity provision experience. Liquidity Providers using Liquidity Book get full control and precision when managing liquidity where and when it’s needed, making it an excellent hub for liquidity that champions both efficiency and composability. Liquidity Book to date has facilitated over $3.15bn in trading volume on Arbitrum and the Decentralized Exchange has welcomed over 470k unique wallets.\n\nThe grant request of 1,510,000 ARB tokens will be utilized to foster and support liquidity growth of key builders that have demonstrated a strong commitment to scaling Arbitrum, and/or have introduced genuine product innovation that has helped to shape the diversity of the Arbitrum One ecosystem. To date this year over 1,400,000 JOE emissions have been utilized towards Arbitrum. Trader Joe will continue to support builders with JOE emissions moving forward.\n\nExecution Strategy:\nTrader Joe’s execution strategy will see 100% of the allocated grant distributed as liquidity mining incentives that will be distributed fully to Liquidity Providers by two incentivization forms, both are unique to the Trader Joe platform and, combined, uphold the values of efficiency, sustainability and accessibility.\n\nSummarised Distribution % Split	Total\nMarket Maker Incentives	66.23%\nAuto-Pool Yield Farms	23.84%\nNew To Arbitrum Builder Allocation (Market Maker Incentives)	9.93%\nTotal	100.00%\nThe incentives will be distributed over the duration of 84 days (12 weeks) with every 28 days (4 weeks) defined as a ‘phase’. A balanced approach will be taken when distributing incentives to ensure consistency throughout the phases. Each phase will see specific protocols selected to receive incentives, enabling a focused approach to incentivization that aids a core objective of the proposal, discovery.\n\nDistribution Form	Phase 1	Phase 2	Phase 3	Total\nMarket Maker Incentives: Native Protocols	17.88%	17.88%	14.57%	50.33%\nMarket Maker Incentives: Multi-Chain Protocols	5.96%	4.64%	5.30%	15.89%\nAuto-Pool Yield Farms	7.95%	7.95%	7.95%	23.84%\nNew To Arbitrum Builder Allocation (Market Maker Incentives)	3.31%	3.31%	3.31%	9.93%\nTotal	35.10%	33.77%	31.13%	100.00%\n1) Liquidity Book Rewards (Market Maker Incentive Program): Grant % allocated 66.23%\nThe Liquidity Book Rewards program was first introduced on Arbitrum and has successfully completed 12 Epochs since its inception on February 8th. This program incorporates a unique incentive mechanism through a competitive scoring system, known as the ‘MakerScore’. It encourages liquidity providers to manage their assets more efficiently, enabling them to earn increased trading fees and boost their MakerScore. A higher MakerScore translates to a larger portion of the available rewards. By introducing a competitive element to yield farming with concentrated liquidity, the program promotes sustainability and benefits builders by enhancing the depth of spot liquidity which improves the trading experience by enabling more swaps to execute with zero slippage thanks to the innovations of the Liquidity Book AMM.\n\nEvery liquidity provider who deposits into a participating liquidity pool is evaluated over the entirety of an Epoch in which they participate, with each Epoch lasting 14 days and each phase containing two Epochs. At the conclusion of each Epoch, The MakerScore is calculated for all participating liquidity providers. These rewards are then distributed to eligible liquidity providers through a smart contract, which vests the rewards over the duration of 7 days. Liquidity providers who have rewards to claim, can do so directly from the liquidity pool page where they accrued them.\n\nFull details for how this program works in its entirety, including formulas used can be found here 14\nAll MakerScore calculations for every Epoch are published for public view here 9\nEach incentivized partner pool will have rewards allocated in one of the three phases, enabling a focused selection of protocols for each phase that aids user discovery and concentrates reward effectiveness. Trader Joe proposes incentives to the following builders on account of key factors demonstrated, such as proven commitment, contribution and product innovation for the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nNative Partners	Phase 1	Phase 2	Phase 3	Total ARB Allocation	% of Total Grant\nGMX (GMX)	120000			120000	7.95%\nTreasure (MAGIC)		120000		120000	7.95%\nRadiant (RDNT)			120000	120000	7.95%\nCamelot (GRAIL)	90000			90000	5.96%\nDopex (DPX)		90000		90000	5.96%\nJones Dao (JONES)			90000	90000	5.96%\nLodestar (LODE)	50000			50000	3.31%\nWINR (WINR)		50000		50000	3.31%\nNitro Cartel (ALP)	10000			10000	0.66%\nSavvy (SVY)		10000		10000	0.66%\nStella (ALPHA)			10000	10000	0.66%\nTotal	270000	270000	220000	760000	50.33%\nMulti-Chain Partners	Phase 1	Phase 2	Phase 3	Total ARB Allocation	% of Total Grant\nStargate (STG)			70000	70000	4.64%\nPendle (PENDLE)	60000			60000	3.97%\nGains (GNS)		50000		50000	3.31%\nWoo (WOO)	30000			30000	1.99%\nLevel (LVL)		20000		20000	1.32%\nSwell (swETH)			10000	10000	0.66%\nTotal	90000	70000	80000	240000	15.89%\n2) Auto-Pools (Automated Liquidity): Grant % allocated 23.84%\nAs a DEX that is supporting liquidity for Arbitrum builders, deep spot liquidity for core pairs is important to ensure that users can seamlessly trade in and out of core tokens with high efficiency.\n\nAuto-Pools is the latest product innovation by Trader Joe. They are designed to automate the balancing of liquidity in a Liquidity Book pool, offering users a highly accessible way to access concentrated liquidity, without the requirement to directly manage a position. Auto-Pools are utilized for core ‘blue chip’ pairs and will serve as an accessible way for users to access Arbitrum Token liquidity mining rewards via a one-click yield farming experience, whilst also supporting the core trading routes that serve all builders and participants in the Arbitrum One ecosystem.\n\nThe allocated incentives will be spread evenly across the total incentive period of 3 months and the rewards will be streamed in a linear distribution that is uninterrupted over that complete timeframe. Over 10% of the allocated grant will be put towards the ARB/ETH pair to ensure robust liquidity throughout the incentivization period.\n\nAUTO POOLS	Phase 1	Phase 2	Phase 3	Total ARB Allocation	% of Total Grant\nETH/USDC	50000	50000	50000	150000	9.93%\nWBTC/ETH	10000	10000	10000	30000	1.99%\nARB/ETH	60000	60000	60000	180000	11.92%\nTotal	120000	120000	120000	360000	23.84%\n3) New to Arbitrum Builder Allocation (via Market Making Incentives): 9.93%\nTrader Joe proposes allocating 150,000 ARB (9.93% of the grant) to support new builders who either launch on Arbitrum during the incentivization period or deploy to it within the same timeframe. This allocation aims to bolster the growth of the Arbitrum Ecosystem by providing crucial early-stage support to promising projects, ensuring their long-term success. Trader Joe has consistently welcomed new builders to Arbitrum and this allocation directly aligns with the Arbitrum DAO’s objectives of expanding the ecosystem.\n\nAny unused ARB would be returned at the end of the proposed incentivization period.\n\nGrant Matching: JOE allocation committed up to 348k tokens\nAs part of the proposed KPI framework, Trader Joe will assess each participating Liquidity Pool 28 days following the end of the incentivization period for that specific Liquidity Pool. If the average TVL over a rolling 7d period falls below 25% of the peak measured TVL over a rolling 7d period during the incentivization period, JOE incentives equivalent to 10% ($ value) of the ARB tokens allocated to the pool will be distributed for a minimum of 2 weeks to a maximum of 4 weeks.\n\nGrant Timeline:\nExecution of the incentives will be structured over 3 phases, each lasting 28 days that run consecutively. Breakdown of the phases and reward allocations across the incentive mechanisms can be viewed above in the Execution Strategy.\n\nPhase 1: Starting from when the grant is received and last for 28 days\nPhase 2: Starts immediately after Phase 1 has finished and lasts for 28 days\nPhase 3: Same as above, lasting for 28 days\nEntire distribution of incentives: 84 consecutive days\nDo you accept the funding of your grant streamed linearly for the duration of your grant proposal, and that the multisig holds the power to halt your stream?\nYes - We acknowledge the linearity of the incentives and the possibility of their altering.

This initiative drove significant metrics, like a 19% increase in TVL and 80 ETH in sequencer revenue generated. We’re requesting a grant between 37,952 and 2,852,044 ARB through January 31st based on achieving the proposed milestones 91 to extend our impact in three core areas:\n\nSticky Liquidity: Leveraging our proprietary long-term Dynamic Liquidity Provisioning (dLP), we aim to incentivize new and existing lenders through an ARB airdrop. This airdrop design secures long-term liquidity by targeting Arbitrum and cross-chain “whitespace” users who have yet to engage with Arbitrum.\n\nEcosystem Enrichment: Our collaborative initiatives with existing protocols—GMX, Camelot, Dopex, and Plutus, aim to diversify liquidity pools, enhance lending options, and foster a robust options market.\n\nFuture Integration: As Radiant readies its Ethereum Mainnet launch and leverages our presence on the BNB Chain, this grant can attract a broader user base to Arbitrum.\n\nThe proposed milestones will insulate the Arbitrum DAO from needing to over-allocate ARB in the event of underperformance. Transparency reports will be issued based on Arbitrum’s incentive framework guidelines, outlining key performance indicators to measure the grant’s effectiveness. Our track record in driving long-term liquidity and user adoption makes us confident this grant will provide substantial and lasting value to the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nKey Performance Indicators (KPIs)\nRadiant will track KPIs such as Incremental TVL, whitespace users, total user growth, and sequencer revenue generated through the initiatives conducted in this proposal, should it be approved. See Section 5 for additional details.\n\nHow will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem?\nThe Radiant protocol’s v2 foundation and utility have proven to be of interest to the Arbitrum ecosystem and beyond. This can be attributed to:\n\nOmnichain Money Market: As DeFi’s first cross-chain lending protocol built atop Layer Zero Labs and Stargate, Radiant allows users to deposit and borrow assets across chains seamlessly. Radiant aims to exist on every EVM chain, unifying tens of billions of fragmented liquidity and eliminating the need for countless transactions to lend, borrow, bridge, and swap between chains.\n\nDeFi 3.0: Early iterations of DeFi featured many copycat protocols with little utility and high-emission governance tokens. With the Radiant DAO’s v2 launch, Radiant continues to allow all users to borrow and lend cross-chain. However, emissions are gated to only users who provide utility to the protocol through Dynamic Liquidity Provisioning 8.\n\nNew collateral support: As the Radiant DAO expands its cross-chain functionality to additional chains, new collateral options will emerge with DAO-voted Loan-To-Value parameters and oracle usage. Radiant is the first significant money market on Arbitrum to support ARB as collateral. It has the second largest TVL of ARB token on the chain behind Uniswap, adding incremental utility to the token by unlocking its borrowing power.\n\nJustification for the size of the grant\nRadiant has grown significantly since its fair launch in July 2022, partly thanks to its revenue-sharing model and community-focused ethos. As the 2nd highest TVL protocol on Arbitrum (including pool2), Radiant holds an 11% share of on-chain TVL, while the grant request is UP TO 5.7% of the $50M short-term budget with milestone guardrails in place.\n\nThe grant proposal and its size deserve consideration for three reasons:\n\nDemonstrated Success: Radiant effectively utilized its initial ARB allocation to deliver positive growth metrics, validating its capability to execute liquidity grants.\n\nMarket Expansion: With a presence on BNB Chain and an impending Mainnet launch, Radiant is uniquely positioned to tap into high-TVL, high-activity user bases across chains. If approved, this grant can drive awareness, interest, and demand into the Arbitrum ecosystem through Radiant’s presence on other chains.\n\nSticky Liquidity: Radiant’s dLP system encourages long-term engagement, evident from the 6-12 month lock periods and the substantial retention of ARB 5 tokens airdropped to users through Radiant’s campaign (⅔ of users that claimed the airdrop held the token).\n\nImpact Metrics on Arbitrum\nFollowing the approval of RFP-18 4, which focused on strategically allocating the initial ARB airdrop from the Arbitrum Foundation to the Radiant DAO, we’ve seen remarkable growth in key metrics. Radiant is now well-positioned to amplify this success.\n\nRadiant is consistently the go-to money market of choice on Arbitrum, evidenced by Nansen’s stats on 7 day users and transactions, generating significant sequencer revenue for the Arbitrum DAO.\n\nAnnounced 2 on May 17 and wrapping up 2 on July 17, the campaign not only moved the needle but also shattered expectations. Specifically, the number of RDNT token holders soared from 77,902 to 130,206—a remarkable 67% growth.\n\nOur cumulative user base leaped from 181,379 to 275,466, marking a substantial 52% increase in Radiant users.\n\nThe campaign also significantly contributed to Arbitrum’s total value locked (TVL), boosting it from $163.9M to nearly $195M—a substantial increase of almost 19%. Compared to other top Arbitrum protocols—GMX and Stargate declining by -12.29% and -17.98%, respectively, and Uniswap dropping by -2.89%—Radiant’s nearly 19% boost in TVL stands out as a notable contributor to Arbitrum’s ecosystem health.\n\nRadiant’s locked dLP on Arbitrum grew by 34.5%, reaching $49.58M by the end of the initial ARB campaign. This supported Radiant’s growth and fortified Arbitrum’s broader liquidity infrastructure. Radiant’s incentive mechanisms are well-aligned with Arbitrum’s overarching goals.\n\nDuring the campaign, Radiant’s protocol generated over 80 ETH in sequencer revenue, resulting in a 10% ROI in this category alone. This underscores the economic viability of the initiative. Additionally, the campaign effectively redistributed and decentralized the governance of Arbitrum to users with long-term mindsets.\nLong-Term Ecosystem Value\nThe Radiant protocol has already injected significant value into the Arbitrum ecosystem and will continue this trajectory, magnified by approving the grant. Since its launch on July 24, 2022, 202 million RDNT tokens have been awarded as incentives for lending, borrowing, and liquidity provision—equating to $46.5M at the current token price of $0.23.\n\nOur existing emissions runway projects a distribution of an additional 100 million RDNT by July 2027. This equates to a future value of $23M.\n\nCrucially, Radiant’s v2 tokenomics are engineered to encourage committed participation. We’ve effectively filtered out mercenary liquidity by requiring dynamic liquidity providers (dLPs) to maintain a 5% dLP ratio to their total deposits for emissions eligibility. These dLPs are also allocated 60% of all protocol fees and influence the DAO’s governance. This way, Radiant’s incentive structure rewards and retains key ecosystem participants.\n\nWith $53M of dLP locked on Arbitrum, the protocol averages $1.2M in monthly fees, according to DeFi Llama. Of these fees, 60% go directly to eligible dLP lockers. Should Radiant sustain and expand this rate, we’re looking at a projected $62M in fees funneled to ecosystem participants by 2027.\nExecution Strategy\n1. New Lenders & Dynamic Liquidity Provider Airdrop (0 to 2,060,440 ARB)\n\nThe amount of ARB granted requires achieving the proposed milestones outlined in the Transparency report 91 by the end of the campaign:\n\nIncremental TVL & new dLP milestones must be attained for grant distribution. If no milestone is reached, this initiative has no payout.\n\nThe incremental TVL determines the total ARB allocation at the end of the campaign, times the airdrop multiplier, divided by the ARB price.\n\nExample campaign results: $13,500,000 (incremental TVL Milestone 3) * .05714 (Multiplier) = 771,390 USD / ARB Price (.91) = 847,681\n\nIncremental TVL & New dLP count from the campaign’s start to end. Incremental TVL is defined as new dLP + unlooped lending TVL.\n\nTVL: Airdrop multiplier increases with the milestones as goalposts to encourage attainment.\n\nThe campaign starts within 30 days post-approval and runs for a randomized duration ending no later than January 31, 2024, to curb gamification.\n\nUsers lock or relock NEW dLP on Arbitrum for 6-12 months to qualify.\n\nThe amount of ARB assigned to each user depends on their total NEW dLP locked against the total NEW Arbitrum dLP value by the end of the campaign.\n\nRadiant will work with an on-chain reputation protocol such as Nomis 7 and/or Trustalabs 4 to identify whitespace users and assign a multiplier score from 0-100…\n\nWhitespace is defined as a user that has transacted reasonably over a duration of time on other EVM chains but has little to no transaction history on Arbitrum.\n\nFor example, user A is eligible for 26 Arb airdrop with a whitespace score 50. The total Arb user A receives is 39 ARB= 26(1+0.5).\n\nPost-campaign, qualified users can claim ARB via Radiant’s claim page.\n\n2. GMX v2 BTC & ETH GM Lender’s Airdrop (0 to 483,516 ARB)\n\nShould this proposal be approved, GMX is positioned as the prime recipient for the highest ecosystem allocation, with distinct advantages in attracting new liquidity and user engagement.\n\nThe selection of BTC and ETH as GM collateral types is underpinned by the relative market size and their potential to maximize revenue streams for Radiant protocol and Arbitrum sequencers.\n\nGMX will push its incentives into v2 (trader rebates and liquidity incentives). They will be voting to create a quick migration path from GLP into GM tokens, and Radiant should be well-positioned to add utility to GM tokens by unlocking their borrowing power.\n\nAirdrops are favored as a more dynamic method to boost demand, as evidenced by Radiant’s prior ARB airdrop campaign and general airdrop activity on EVM chains.\n\nThe amount of ARB granted requires achieving the proposed milestones outlined in the Transparency report 91 by the end of the campaign:\n\nTo qualify for the airdrop, GM Radiant lenders must maintain a 5% ratio of dLP to total deposits 9 at the block number the campaign period ends (will be announced on socials).\n\nIf approved, a second proposal requires ratification within Radiant DAO governance to add GM collateral support, followed by a 30-to-90-day implementation period involving dev work, risk assessments, audits, and testing. If the proposal does not pass, the allocation of ARB for this initiative is no longer required.\n\nExample campaign results: $2,300,000 (GMX V2 TVL Milestone 2) * .02 (Multiplier) = 46,000 USD / ARB Price (.91) = 50,549\n\n3. Camelot v3 + Dopex v2 RDNT/ETH Liquidity Incentives (28,062 to 242,154 ARB)\n\nCamelot recently launched a v3 concentrated liquidity pool for RDNT/ETH with xgrail market maker incentives.\n\nDopex v2 is estimated to launch in October/November. Users can deposit their concentrated liquidity AMM (CLAMM) positions in the upgrade, such as Camelot v3 LPs. The CLAMM will allow users to exercise at any time, a departure from the European options that Dopex has used. This is a unified layer of liquidity layer for Dopex products.\n\nDopex v2 allows for higher efficiency with concentrated liquidity positions and enables the ecosystem to hedge RDNT positions on-chain, providing ways to mitigate downside exposure.\n\nThe initiative fits well with previous grant proposals by adding utility and flexibility to Radiant while increasing the potential for Camelot & Dopex to gain incremental volume and users.\n\nCamelot’s proposal includes 20,000 ARB bi-weekly allocated to the RDNT/ETH pool. Should their proposal pass, this will be factored into the table, and unused ARB will either be reallocated to Dopex v2 within the milestone parameters or returned to the Arbitrum DAO at the end of the campaign.\n\nPlutusDAO: plsRDNT Incentives (9,890 to 65,934 ARB)\n\nPlutus DAO, known as Arbitrum’s governance “black hole,” controls over $1.7M in plsRDNT, a product that locks dLP for 12 months and funnels Radiant’s protocol revenue back to stakers.\n\nThe impending introduction of plvRDNT will expand utility by using dLP eligibility 9 to enable lending and borrowing features for its users in Radiant’s money markets.\n\nPlutus seeks to offer users an exit route via the Chronos DEX liquidity pool. The current need is to align user demand better, as staking plsRDNT offers greater utility than mere liquidity provision.\n\nThe launch of plvRDNT should augment the GMX proposal by enabling Plutus to unlock over $34M in lending potential within Radiant’s money market.\n\nAn evaluation period will determine the most suitable DEX for this liquidity pair, whether Chronos or another platform, followed by a four-month co-incentivization phase with Plutus based on the proposed milestones and distribution schedule.\n\nGrant Timeline\nIf the Arbitrum DAO prefers to send a linear bi-weekly stream, then the maximum allocation of 2,842,046 can be sent linearly via bi-weekly streams through January 31, 2024. After campaign completion, unused ARB based on milestone attainment will be returned to the Arbitrum DAO.\n\nRadiant recommends executing 2 bi-weekly payouts at Milestone 1 for Camelot/Dopex and Plutus initiatives before enforcing the milestone criteria to allow sufficient time to build awareness, interest, and demand. If Milestone 1 is not reached by the 3rd bi-weekly stream, then incentives may cease and be reassessed at the next bi-weekly stream until Milestone 1 is achieved.\n\nDo you accept the funding of your grant streamed linearly for the duration of your grant proposal, and that the multisig holds the power to halt your stream?\nYes, however, any unilateral cancellation or modification of the campaign’s terms related to the airdrops post-announcement would constitute a breach of good faith and could undermine community trust. Based on the proposed airdrop framework, users will choose to lock liquidity for six months to one year and therefore this should only be done in very extreme circumstances.\n\nSECTION 4: PROTOCOL DETAILS\nIs the Protocol Native to Arbitrum?\nRadiant launched on Arbitrum on July 24, 2022, as the first chain deployment. We consider Arbitrum our home - most of Radiant’s TVL, community, and marketing efforts are conducted on Arbitrum.\n\nArbitrum’s transaction fee mitigation, combined with Ethereum’s security and institutional adoption, enables Radiant to build an ecosystem that provides users competitive interest-bearing opportunities while maintaining high safety.\n\nRadiant built its money market on top of Layer Zero Labs and the Stargate stable router interface to facilitate seamless cross-chain lending and borrowing. Radiant’s omnichain ambitions should not be a deterrent and should be seen as a net benefit to the ecosystem. Radiant can tap into other user bases through its presence on other chains. Even when users borrow cross-chain from Arbitrum, their deposited collateral remains on Arbitrum.\n\nOn what other networks is the protocol deployed?\nRadiant v2 was deployed on BNB chain in April 2023, with a pending deployment on Ethereum Mainnet in October 2023.\n\nWhat date did you deploy on Arbitrum?\n7/24/22.\n\nProtocol Performance\nAchievements by the 1st Year Anniversary 7/24/23.\n\nArbitrum’s top lending protocol by TVL ($204M) and daily active users (DAUs).\n\nBNB Chain’s #2 in lending TVL ($93M) and leader in DAUs.\n\nGenerated $16M in protocol fees, fully distributed as real yield.\n\nRanked #2 in lending protocol revenue across ALL DeFi, with only two chain deployments (Arbitrum & BNB chain)\n\n154K token holders and 217K protocol users.\n\nLocked $76M in dLP—$55M on Arbitrum and the rest on BNB Chain—with a total market size exceeding $500M.\n\nIn a 180-day earnings comparison, $RDNT led with $3.8M, edging out $AAVE ($3.6M) and $XVS ($1.6M).\n\nWhile working towards its goal of seamless omnichain lending, Radiant has already delivered on its aim for cost efficiency with a competitive price-to-fee (P/F) ratio of 23.7x—far outpacing Aave’s 69.9x and Venus’ 38.1x.\n\nProtocol Roadmap\nRadiant’s roadmap is governed by community discussions and snapshots. You can see progress and history here:\n\nhttps://dao.radiant.capital 5\n\nhttps://community.radiant.capital/ 2\n\nGeneral roadmap:\n\nhttps://docs.radiant.capital/radiant/other-info/radiant-dao-roadmap 3\n\nAudit History\nWhile Radiant v2 is primarily composed of the same codebase as Radiant v1 (audited by Peckshield and Solidity Finance) — the Radiant DAO takes safety & security seriously and tripled down on audits.\n\nRadiant conducted 4 top-to-bottom v2 audits with Peckshield 1, Zokyo, BlockSec, and OpenZepplin (report forthcoming) with zero unresolved critical or high issues. Members of the white-hacking community and participants of the ongoing ImmuneFi bounty 1 program are also leveraged to buttress potential vulnerabilities.\n\nSECTION 5: DATA & REPORTING\nMilestones, Distribution Schedule, Growth Metrics, and Transaction History\nA dune dashboard and/or Excel reporting will track every ARB allocation, milestone attainment, related growth metrics, and transaction history. These specs ensure transparent funds tracking, accountability, and performance, aligned with Arbitrum’s broader objectives.\n\nThese reports will be shared and updated based on the incentive framework guidelines to facilitate timely analysis and discussion. Below is a summary of the objectives and parameters and a sample transparency report template.\n\nLink: Transparency Reports template 91\nRadiant’s Dune dashboard can be viewed here: https://dune.com/defimochi/radiant-capital 15\n\nThe provided proposal serves solely as a source of information and does not forge any legal commitment or pact between Radiant, Arbitrum DAO, or any other involved entities.

Since launching in April 2023, Vertex has grown to the leading DEX on Arbitrum by daily volume and is consistently one of the top 10 gas-consuming applications on the network.\n\nTrading volumes to date exceed $7.9B in aggregate, with $2B traded in the last 30 days (as of October 2, 2023). During that period, Vertex has also achieved:\n\n$9.1M in TVL.\n6,203 unique depositors.\nTLDR: Vertex STIP Round 1 Highlights — Slide Deck:\n\ndocs.google.com\nVertex_STIP_Proposal_Slide_Presentation 119\nVERTEX - STIP PRESENTATION +\n\nTeam Members and Qualifications:\n\nDarius Tabatabai – Co-Founder: Head of Trading at CrossTower and JST; Global Head of Precious Metals Trading at CS and Global Head of Metals Trading at BAML; 20 years of trading experience in options, commodities, and FX.\n\nAlwin Peng – Co-Founder: Youngest-ever employee at Jump; Founder at RandomEarth (NFT marketplace on Terra).\n\nSJ Park – Head of Strategy: 10 years of trading experience in Rates and Credit; Portfolio Manager at Goldman Sachs.\n\nJeff Blockinger – General Counsel: 26 years of legal experience across multiple disciplines; Chief Legal Officer at Och-Ziff, taking Och-Ziff public in its IPO; CEO at Association for Digital Asset Markets.\n\nProject links:\n\nWebsite: vertexprotocol.com 49\n\nWeb App: app.vertexprotocol.com 22\n\nDocumentation: Overview - Vertex Docs 7\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/vertex_protocol 8\n\nDiscord: Vertex Protocol 1\n\nBlog: https://blog.vertexprotocol.com/ 1\n\nGithub: GitHub - vertex-protocol/vertex-contracts 2\n\nAPI: API - Vertex Docs 2\n\nSDK (Typescript): Vertex Typescript SDK - Vertex Docs\n\nSDK (Python): Vertex Protocol Python SDK — Vertex Protocol SDK 0.1.0 documentation 1\n\nContracts: Contracts - Vertex Docs 7\n\nContact Information\nTwitter: @vertex_protocol\n\nEmail: community@vertexprotocol.com\n\nDo You Acknowledge That Your Team Will Be Subject to a KYC Requirement?:\n\nYes\n\nSECTION 2: GRANT INFORMATION\nRequested Grant Size:\n\nTrading Rewards = 1.35M – 2.55M ARB total (450K – 850K ARB per 28-day epoch)\n\nFusion Pools: Powered by Elixir Protocol (“Elixir”) Liquidity Incentives = Up to 450K ARB total (150K ARB per 28-day epoch)\n\nTotal = 1.8M – 3M ARB (600K – 1M ARB per epoch)\n\nThe higher end is achieved if:\n\nVertex averages in excess of 140M USD volume daily. (>2x current levels)\n\nElixir onboards > average 10M USD TVL.\n\nElixir currently has >5M in stablecoin liquidity demand for Vertex Fusion pools.\n\nNaturally, this brings additional liquidity into the ecosystem.\n\nAbout Elixir Protocol\n\nAs part of the Vertex proposal, the grant will help subsidize Elixir Liquidity Providers (“LPs”) (available on the Vertex front-end shortly) with a baseline level of $ARB APY that incentivize a core base of liquidity while increasing the volume of Vertex as an Arbitrum-native DEX that positively impacts broader Arbitrum chain at large.\n\nElixir’s protocol will be powering Vertex’s upcoming “Fusion Pools” product, allowing users to supply USDC collateral to build up the orderbooks of perpetual futures as well as spot pairs on the exchange. End-users will tap into the VRTX incentives offered by Vertex in our ongoing incentives to reward their liquidity.\n\nElixir is building the industry’s first decentralized, algorithmic market-making protocol. Through the Elixir Protocol, anyone will be able to passively supply liquidity to orderbook pairs on perp DEXes across the space, earning subsidized APYs from existing long-term liquidity incentive programs offered by exchanges like Vertex.\n\nElixir’s underlying infrastructure is decentralized and high-throughput. The off-chain protocol reaches consensus on every order placed on an exchange. The infrastructure is similar to Arbitrum’s security model, with the protocol’s fraud proofs posted on-chain after being validated by a network of (at the present moment) 15,000 testnet v2 validators. All contracts are audited by Trail of Bits, with the Vertex integration going live in the coming weeks.\n\nElixir has roughly $5M in institutional capital lined up as a core base of liquidity for Vertex pairs, not including the retail liquidity from farmers and users that this will unlock. On launch, they will also make it as easy as possible for users to bridge capital from any chain into the Elixir contracts on Arbitrum via a native Stargate integration.\n\nFor further information about Elixir:\n\nWebsite: https://elixir.finance/ 17\nDocumentation: https://docs.elixir.finance/ 1\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/ElixirProtocol 3\nDiscord: Elixir\nGrant Matching:\n\nVertex currently runs a generous rewards program 26. The program will continue alongside the incentives program proposed below giving dual incentives for trading to users, with approximately 10M VRTX tokens being allocated to each epoch.\n\nGrant Breakdown:\n\nThe grant will target increased volume and liquidity via Vertex’s highly performant orderbook architecture.\n\nThe grant will be used for three primary purposes:\n\nIncentivize Community-Based Market-Making (Elixir):\n\nVertex and Elixir have been partners for several months, and are poised to finalize the integration of Elixir’s Fusion Pools on Vertex’s front end, which allows retail users to LP orderbook pairs on Vertex and accumulate $VRTX Trading Rewards.\n\nIncentivizing Arbitrum DeFi users deploying liquidity into the Elixir fusion pools on Vertex with a baseline APR of 15% in $ARB on their assets.\n\nTrading Rewards:\n\nRewards on trading fees up to a maximum of 75% of the taker fee paid. The balance will be split proportionately if:\n\n75% * Total Trading Fees > Allocated Grant Available\n\nSequencer Fee Removal:\n\nShould this proposal pass, Vertex is committed to removing sequencer fees on all trading pairs for the 3 months during which the incentives would be in effect. For a summary of Vertex’s sequencer fees, you can find them in the Vertex documentation here 9.\nTrading fees and liquidity incentives evince a significant impact on the demand for trading on any given exchange venue. Vertex already offers class-leading fees: the grant’s motivation is to increase liquidity and trading volumes by introducing more users to the Arbitrum ecosystem via incentivizing liquidity and broader participation in the ecosystem.\n\nThe proposed grant would unlock a compelling trading incentive structure without sequencer fees – bringing more capital to Arbitrum to trade. Additionally, the proposal would empower Vertex to maximize the transaction activity of on-chain traders.\n\nPaired with a performant orderbook and broad product offering, trading rewards will accelerate Vertex and Arbitrum’s growth trajectory, stimulating trading demand and onboarding new users into the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nThe grant for each epoch will be equal to the total of:\n\nTrading Rewards = Min [USD Volume * Trading fees * 75%, 850K ARB per epoch]\n\nElixir Incentives = Min [15% * TVL * ⅓, 150k]\n\nTotal = 600K - 1M ARB per epoch\n\nIf the total Taker Fees over 3 epochs (roughly three months) do not amount to a sum greater than 3M ARB, the remaining balance will be returned to the DAO.\n\nFunding Address:\n\narb1:0x66993CA98A1ecf4F746FCDbDEdfC69E95529fB0E\n\nFunding Address Characteristics:\n\n3/5 multisig with securely stored private keys distributed across the Vertex core team.\n\nContract Address:\n\nVertex Router: 0xbbee07b3e8121227afcfe1e2b82772246226128e\n\nSECTION 3: GRANT OBJECTIVES AND EXECUTION\nObjectives:\n\nThe ultimate goal is to position Vertex as a premier order book DEX that can overtake dYdX as the leader in the DEX space within DeFi – attracting more liquidity and users to Arbitrum. Primarily, achieving a positive outcome means surpassing dYdX in both:\n\nTrading Volume\n\nUser Base\n\nAccomplishing the intended objective will elevate Vertex and Arbitrum, and infuse the Arbitrum ecosystem with increased liquidity and interest from traders – one of the largest user demographics within DeFi. Under extended bearish market conditions, pursuing a strategy that captures more traders and creates a moat around that inflow of new users is a compelling long-term tactic for the Arbitrum DAO.\n\nA potential surge in trading activity and users can be harnessed by other projects in the Arbitrum ecosystem. For example, more organic, on-chain trading demand native to the network fosters a ripple effect across other Arbitrum projects where Vertex can serve as a liquidity hub for low-cost, performant trading.\n\nNewcomers to the Arbitrum ecosystem seeking more cost-effective on-chain trading can use Vertex as a starting point to explore everything Arbitrum has to offer.\n\nKey Performance Indicators (KPIs):\n\nKPIs for success:\n\nElixir LP Program\n\nGiven the focus on TVL for this part of the program, 150K ARB is to be allocated every month for three months, with yield capped at 15% for LPs.\n\nIf TVL > 10M USD, all ARB will be distributed.\n\nIf the average TVL over that period is < 10M USD, then a pro-rata amount will be distributed, with the balance sent back to the DAO.\n\nNote: Depending on the market price of ARB tokens and average TVL over the grant period.\n\nTrading Rewards Program\n\nThe key KPI for the trading rewards program will be trading volumes. As set out in the grant size justification below, it is envisaged that the grant will only be fully utilized if average daily volumes are in excess of 140M USD daily (depending on ARB token prices during the course of the program).\n\nHow will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem?:\n\nBring TVL to Arbitrum:\n\nTraders seeking to benefit from Vertex’s market-leading fees and proposed liquidity incentives during this period will need to deposit assets for trading on Arbitrum. The proposed incentive structure, combined with Vertex’s unified margin engine and hybrid design, provides a more compelling case for both retail and sophisticated traders to become Arbitrum-native users.\n\nLiquidity Providers (LPs) market-making via Vertex’s partnership with Elixir Protocol will also need to deploy capital into the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nGrow Liquidity:\n\nThe activity growth encouraged by incentives will also encourage more market-making activity. The benefits to market-making amplify as increased volumes boost market-maker profitability – capturing more institutional capital on Arbitrum.\n\nThis on-chain liquidity can be deployed to further other activity within the Arbitrum ecosystem, including yield strategies, arbitrage, and price discovery – all of which benefit other protocols besides Vertex.\n\nThe addition of Elixir Protocol will help distribute this activity to community members who can become a part of the core liquidity on Vertex.\n\nGenerate Sequencer Revenue:\n\nIncreased on-chain activity generates more revenue for the Arbitrum DAO via gas fees. Essentially, a portion of this grant converts ARB tokens into ETH sequencer fees, helping to diversify the DAO Treasury’s revenue source.\n\nDiversifying treasury revenue sources is a highly relevant topic for the Arbitrum DAO at large, and has often been an area where many DAOs have struggled in the past – typically, maintaining a significant majority of their capital base in the native token. It’s an area where Arbitrum can choose to be more judicious and help promote activities that further this aim.\n\nJustification for the size of the grant:\n\nLiquidity incentives can potentially push Vertex volumes into the top spot for DEXs across ecosystems, unseating dYdX as the market leader – and benefitting the broader Arbitrum ecosystem. In the longer term, it would help Vertex evaluate the effect of lower fees for capturing more trading activity to the benefit of users and partners.\n\nTrading Incentives\n\nAs incentives are disbursed there are two main outcomes:\n\n<~140M USD Daily Volume:\n\nVertex fails to grow more than 2x from current levels.\nIncentives are capped by 75% of trading fees provision.\nFull grant request is not needed, estimated cost < 3M ARB.\nVertex gets scaling data on the effects of trading rewards to help direct business models in the future.\nArbitrum gets data on the cost-effectiveness of incentives to Vertex.\n> ~140M Daily Volume:\n\nScale is achieved Vertex more than 2X.\nVertex grows into a high-volume market leader that absorbs more organic on-chain trading demand for Arbitrum.\nCosts cap out at 2.55M total ARB, incentives distributed pro-rata vs. trading fees spent.\n*NB – We use 140M as a reference point as we can think of it as the point where the incentives reach targeted effect by more than doubling Vertex’s trading activity.\n\n140M = (EpochGrant Size*Price_ARB)/(Vertex_FeeCapture/28DaysinEpoch)\nWhere:\n\nARB price = 0.8285 USDC and Vertex Fee Capture = 0.0175%\nElixir Incentives\n\nIn both cases, the absorption of new LP TVL into Vertex via Elixir should prove sticky and help provide backup liquidity to the existing market maker flow that exists on the platform, and cost no more than 450K ARB.\n\nExecution Strategy:\n\nThe grant will be held in a ⅗ multi-sig.\n\nARB tokens will be disbursed using tooling already built for Vertex’s internal token program.\n\nElixir’s Fusion Pool incentives will be paid by the Vertex team using Elixir as agent.\n\nGrant Timeline:\n\nOnce the grant is confirmed:\n\nEstablish three separate, four-week epochs (12 weeks total) commencing immediately upon the proposal’s passing.\n\nPublicize the incentives to garner interest and on-chain trading demand.\n\nPrepare a report on the grant results, which can be built quickly but will need at least four weeks of data to properly demonstrate efficacy.\n\nOnce the 3 months conclude, and if grants are not utilized, the remaining ARB tokens will be returned to the DAO treasury.\n\nDo you accept the funding of your grant streamed linearly for the duration of your grant proposal, and that the multisig holds the power to halt your stream?\n\nYes\n\nSECTION 4: PROTOCOL DETAILS\nProvide details about the Arbitrum protocol requirements relevant to the grant. This information ensures that the applicant is aligned with the technical specifications and commitments of the grant.\n\nIs the Protocol Native to Arbitrum?:\n\nYes – Vertex is only available on Arbitrum.\n\nOn what other networks is the protocol deployed?:\n\nN/A\n\nWhat date did you deploy on Arbitrum?:\n\nJune 2022 2 - Core team commits to building on Arbitrum.\n\nOctober 2022 - The first version of the protocol launches on Testnet.\n\nApril 2023 - Beta testing begins on mainnet with trading competition.\n\n26th April 2023 - Full mainnet launch\n\n—\n\nProtocol Performance:\n\nThe charts and graphics below express Vertex’s current key growth metrics pulled from third-party data providers and internal dashboards.\n\nImpressive & Steady Volume Growth:\n\nVolumes on Vertex are gradually increasing amid an extended bear market and historically low trading volumes across crypto. As of October 2, 2023:\n\n7-day Volume = $391M\n30-day Volume = $2B\nAll-time Volume = $7.9B\n\n752×390 37.3 KB\n\n1484×762 59.6 KB\n\nSource – https://dune.com/frijoles/vertex?undefined= 10\nVertex’s growth places it amongst the fastest growing protocols across all of DeFi in the midst of a widespread bear market, as well as a leading derivatives DEX by volume. This grant application will help support Vertex’s low-cost, high-volume philosophy and help drive Arbitrum as the leading blockchain for on-chain derivatives trading: essential if dYdX dominance is to be challenged.\n\n\nChart\n1200×742 60.2 KB\n\nSource – Token Terminal (Percentage shown is share of Top 10 derivatives flow)\nUser Metrics:\n\nSince launch, Vertex has onboarded approximately 6,000 unique users, with 150 - 550 users transacting on the platform on a daily basis. They have shown strong retention rates, and the average visit duration of roughly 11 minutes on the Vertex app is significantly above average for DeFi applications. The visit duration on the app exists in spite of geofencing the US market, where US-based web traffic closely mirrors the high bounce rate (~40%) for the Vertex app domain.\n\n\n1600×716 138 KB\n\nSource – SimilarWeb (SimilarWeb Identity 1)\nThe user base continues to grow despite challenging market conditions, lagging market interest, and generally deflated volumes on crypto exchanges.\n\n\n1600×785 142 KB\n\nSource –https://stats.vertexprotocol.com/ 7\nLiquidity:\n\nVertex’s order book provides over $1M of executable liquidity on BTC and ETH perps within 0.10% of mid-price at exceptionally low fee levels. Vertex’s integration with Elixir will further deepen liquidity and improve execution for trading.\n\n\nMarket depth is echoed on ALT pairs with liquidity in the range of $100K-500K within 0.20% of mid-prices.\n\nCoupled with low fees, actionable trading depth on Vertex is unparalleled by other DEXs, which remain constrained by the TVL inefficiencies of AMM and pool-based models where liquidity is limited in some combination of depth, fees or scaling. Conventional x*y=k are incredibly inefficient, and at some point, pool-based derivatives DEXs are always at risk of exhausting their liquidity.\n\nGas Consumption:\n\nVertex consistently ranks amongst the top gas-consuming applications on Arbitrum 6.\n\nThe core Vertex contracts regularly consume 0.5% - 2.5% of the total gas fee market on Arbitrum.\n\n\n1600×406 36 KB\n\n1237×672 25.1 KB\n\nSource – https://dune.com/vrtxc/arbitrum-gas-usage 6\nProtocol Roadmap:\n\nThe Vertex team has committed to community direction for roadmap planning as the protocol build is based on a responsive and agile philosophy that can adapt to the dynamism characteristic of DeFi. That being said, Vertex has pushed out numerous features since launch, including:\n\nOne-Click Trading: Allows users to sign one transaction from and begin trading without further wallet signing – offering users a simplified trading UX on par with CEXs.\n\nPools Page: Vertex’s integrated AMM enables LPs as margin and conventional x*y=k asset pools where liquidity from the AMM is injected into the orderbook.\n\nReferrals: Anyone can generate a referral code and earn boosted trading rewards from their referrals.\n\nPortfolio Page: More granular charts for user accounts on Vertex displaying portfolio stats like value, PnL, Balances, and Perp Trading.\n\nTrading Pins: Users can always monitor their accounts with customizable pins within the Vertex UI to tailor their trading experience to their preferences.\n\nNew Markets: 23 markets have been added to Vertex since launch, including 19 perps and 4 spot markets.\n\nLikely priorities for the next 12 months include:\n\nCross-chain integrations to help bring more users to Arbitrum.\n\nIsolated Margin Accounts to simplify Vertex for retail users. Vertex utilizes unified cross-margin 2 by default across spot, perps, and its embedded money market to maximize capital efficiency. Isolated margin would enable standard isolated margin perps as well, which are a popular request by users.\n\nA mobile trading app to further expand Vertex’s appeal for different types of users. For example, the goal is to appeal to demographics like Robinhood traders in traditional equity markets who are interested in crypto trading and who primarily trade from the Robinhood mobile app.\n\nSmart contract accounts to simplify and abstract away challenges with wallet UX.\n\nAudit History:\n\nVertex maintains an ongoing relationship with the well-reputed auditing firm, OtterSec. OtterSec completed a full audit of the Vertex contracts prior to the mainnet launch, and continually provides auditing services and feedback on the Vertex codebase. The latest full audit from Ottersec is below:\n\n\nvertex-protocol.gitbook.io\n\nOpen-Source Contracts & Code Audit 1\nView the open-source Vertex contracts & the full code audit report from OtterSec's security team.\n\nSECTION 5: Data and Reporting\nProvide details on how your team is equipped to provide data and reporting on grant distribution.\n\nIs your team prepared to create Dune Dashboards for your incentive program?:\n\nYes. Vertex is integrated with Dune Analytics via dashboards created by third parties and the team also maintains internal reporting tools.\n\nDune Analytics: https://dune.com/frijoles/vertex?undefined= 10\n\nVertex Stats Dashboard: https://stats.vertexprotocol.com/ 7\n\nDoes your team agree to provide bi-weekly program updates on the Arbitrum Forum thread?\n\nThe proposed reporting would be based on constructing a suitable Dune Analytics dashboard specific to the outcome of the proposal’s incentives.\n\nThe dashboard would primarily capture the metrics expressed below as a rate of growth compared to the growth rate before incentives to illustrate a clearer picture of the incentives’ overall impact. This approach allows for isolating changes directly attributable to the incentive program, where a comparison of the post-incentive growth rates to the pre-incentive rate can be more accurately evaluated.\n\nComparison of the following growth metrics on a relative basis before and after the proposed incentives include:\n\nTrading Volume: Measure the percentage change in trading volume, comparing it to the pre-incentive period.\n\nProtocol Revenue: Calculate the percentage increase in trading fee revenue relative to the pre-incentive period.\n\nNew User & Retention Rate Comparison: Measure the percentage growth in the number of new users and active users compared to the pre-incentive phase – along with any changes in the user retention rate. This data can be supplemented with publicly available web traffic tools and analytics.\n\nTVL Growth: Measure the growth of TVL during the incentives period.\n\nCost Analysis: Sequencer fees & market maker rebates changes.\n\nMore specific to the broader impact on the Arbitrum DAO, analyses composed of the following will also be applied to the dashboard:\n\nARB token impact: Report on how many tokens are distributed and to how many wallets\n\nGas Consumption Rate: Measuring any statistically significant variance in on-chain gas consumption of the Vertex contracts relative to current and historical data.\n\nThese metrics will help draw conclusions on the impact of token grants and how they can influence future thinking on Vertex’s fee model. They will also provide actionable data on how to optimize grants utilizing alternative incentive models in the future.\n\nDoes your team acknowledge that failure to comply with any of the above requests can result in the halting of the program’s funding stream?:\n\nYes",Short Term Incentive Program
https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/camelot-final-stip-round-1/17200,"SECTION 1: APPLICANT INFORMATION\nApplicant Name:\nIronboots, 0xMyrddin\n\nProject Name:\nCamelot\n\nProject Description:\nAs Arbitrum’s largest native DEX, Camelot provides custom liquidity infrastructure tooling and fosters a collaborative environment for innovation that incentivizes teams to build specifically on Arbitrum.\n\nCamelot offers one of the broadest range of liquidity pools on Arbitrum and is a natural hub for both users and builders. With over 48 partner pools, Camelot has introduced numerous protocols to the ecosystem and has close relationships with the largest builders such as GMX, Pendle, Radiant, Dopex, Plutus and more. Camelot moves beyond the traditional role of a DEX to also provide extensive support and advisory for liquidity structuring, emissions management and more.\n\nCamelot provides a full suite of liquidity products from a custom-built incentive layer to integrated concentrated liquidity strategies, allowing Arbitrum builders to achieve a bespoke balance of efficiency and practicality. Camelot can cater towards liquidity that requires maximum efficiency, whilst also providing support for illiquid long-tail assets. In turn, this leads to the most sustainable and economical liquidity across both protocol tokens and core assets, as displayed by the diverse fee generation and TVL graphs detailed below.\n\n\n1280×936 115 KB\nimage\nimage\n600×700 68.3 KB\nTeam Members and Qualifications:\n\n0xMyrddin, cofounder, dev\nPercival, cofounder, dev\nIronBoots, cofounder, BD & growth\nVivi, marketing and community\n0xCrema, quant advisor\nDanny, BD\nDipplo, community\nCryptonix, community\nSeveral external contractors for development and security work\nProject Links:\n\nhttps://app.camelot.exchange 38\nhttps://twitter.com/CamelotDEX 8\nCamelot | Twitter | Linktree 5\nContact Information:\n\nTG: @iron_boots, @0xmyrddin\n\nTwitter: @sirbootsofiron, @0xmyrddin\n\nEmail: partnerships@camelot.fi\n\nDo You Acknowledge That Your Team Will Be Subject to a KYC Requirement?: YES\n\nSECTION 2: GRANT INFORMATION\nRequested Grant Size:\n3.09m ARB*\n(*minimum of 1.87m spent, up to 3.09m based on methodology and KPIs detailed below)\n\nGrant Matching:\nCamelot’s existing liquidity incentives to be maintained or increased, including various external rewards provided by partners\n\nGrant Breakdown:\nCamelot will allocate up to 3.09m ARB tokens as liquidity incentives over 3 months in the following categories, with the majority of the incentives focusing on partner pools and the broader adoption of $ARB as a base liquidity asset. Camelot will receive 512k per epoch and intends to begin the initial distribution with 400k ARB. Depending on the performance the following epochs can be increased or decreased by a maximum of 10%, thereby creating a min and max range of 1.87m to 3.09m ARB in total. This is shown below in the relevant table. Any ARB that has not been used will be returned at the end of the programme.\n\nThe distribution will leverage a variety of methods, including highly efficient concentrated liquidity strategies, Nitro pools, and other custom-built features as part of Camelot’s battle-tested infrastructure. Further justification and details for all incentive allocations are included throughout the rest of this application.\n\nTotal Incentives	Avg incentives per epoch (bi-weekly)	% of total\nPartner Pools	1,543,122	257,187	50%\nARB Pools	617,249	102,875	20%\nCore Pools	617,249	102,875	20%\nReserved for new partners	308,624	51,437	10%\nTotal	3,086,244	514,374	\nimage\nimage\n745×88 9.95 KB\nCamelot supports over 40 partners, and a breakdown of each pool and its initial distribution is included in the spreadsheet below. Camelot is committed to a sustainable & methodical approach and will therefore be adjusting emissions each epoch basis the relevant KPIs and metrics, which includes fees generated, volume, TVL, incentives per pool, and more. Most importantly, Camelot’s ability to distribute to a broad variety of pools is only possible through its continued expansion and scaling over the past year, and is not something that can be easily replicated with simple formulas.\n\nCAMELOT ARB ALLOCATION BREAKDOWN 217\n\nAs part of Camelot’s commitment to sustainability, the total incentives distributed for each epoch will be based on the performance of the KPIs, with a maximum adjustment of +/- 10%. This ensures that incentives are not being used without a clear justification for their effectiveness, and is reflected in the above table. In addition, the reserve portion will be specifically used to onboard new protocols or partners that are not included in the initial scope.\n\nFunding Address: 0x2301273b4515ae8EC752B0041E7F4142408BEFBC\n\nFunding Address Characteristics: 2/3 multisig (IronBoots, Percival, 0xMyrddin)\n\nContract Address: The entirety of the ARB allocation will happen through Camelot’s Nitro pools solution (https://docs.camelot.exchange/protocol/nitro-pools 15) and Merkl (https://merkl.angle.money 19), depending on the profile and needs of each specific pair.\nNo contract address can’t be shared before the distribution is actually set up, but Camelot will permanently keep a list all of them up to date during the entire duration of the campaign.\n\nSECTION 3: GRANT OBJECTIVES AND EXECUTION\nObjectives:\nCamelot was conceived to help deliver Arbitrum’s goal of scaling and revolutionizing the future of Ethereum. Through its commitment to supporting native builders, Camelot strives to build the foundation of sustainable liquidity and collaboration that will allow Arbitrum and its diverse ecosystem to thrive.\n\nCamelot has a proven track record of bringing in new builders to the ecosystem (Pendle, Vela, Thales, DMT, Aurory, Lyra, and many more) whilst also forming deep relationships with core native protocols such as GMX, Jones, Radiant, Plutus, Dopex, and more. Camelot is uniquely positioned to work closely with these partners to support the broader adoption of ARB as a base asset. The majority of new Arbitrum projects list their initial liquidity on Camelot, which provides the best opportunity to work with partners to seed their pools with ARB from launch.\n\nMost importantly, Camelot has developed a comprehensive suite of liquidity products to offer protocols a wide range of tailored options. Whilst volume and TVL numbers can often vary depending on the liquidity profile of a token and market conditions, fees generated can be used as a more consistent reference for the performance of a pool. In this case, Camelot’s flexibility allows for significantly higher fee generation. Consistent fees generated is the primary source of real yield for users, and therefore provides a long-term solution that isn’t entirely reliant on incentives. Concentrated liquidity pools can be incentivized efficiently through Merkl or automated managers, while less liquid and more volatile partner tokens can achieve efficient fee generation through standard XYK pools and our Nitro pool infrastructure. We believe that there is no ‘one size fits all’ approach, and the Camelot protocol has been built to reflect that.\n\nThe objectives are clear:\n\nOnboard new protocols to the Arbitrum ecosystem by offering bespoke liquidity support and incentives for new protocols\n\nAs part of the support for new token listings, Camelot is uniquely positioned to encourage the use of $ARB in protocol-owned-liquidity, making it the most attractive option for new protocols\nIncrease adoption of the $ARB token by incentivising protocols to adopt $ARB as a paired asset whilst also incentivising highly efficient $ARB base liquidity\n\nDeepen spot liquidity for Arbitrum’s key protocols by incentivising ecosystem partner pools, offering bespoke support catered to each projects requirements\n\nLeverage a data driven, dynamic approach to increase the sustainability of incentives and achieve long-term sticky liquidity across a broad range of pools\n\nIncrease overall protocol liquidity depth on Arbitrum by incentivizing and supporting protocols to leverage Camelot’s concentrated-liquidity solutions\n\nCamelot will leverage its natively integrated automated liquidity managers to incentivize concentrated liquidity efficiently and in a user-friendly manner. Concentrated liquidity traditionally requires active and manual management, so this solution allows us to provide a passive option that caters to a wider range of user needs.\n\nCamelot will use its Merkl integration to distribute incentives directly to concentrated liquidity providers. Through Merkle, the most efficient LPs are rewarded based on their generated fees, making it one of the most effective methods of incentive distribution.\nCamelot’s custom-built incentive layer (spNFTs and Nitro pools) allows for highly focused and permissionless incentivisation, allowing partners to provide additional rewards\nStimulate broader collaboration and broader development growth in the ecosystem\n\nKey Performance Indicators (KPIs):\nTVL growth\nFees growth\nVolume growth\nAdoption of ARB as a base asset\nNew partners and protocols supported on Arbitrum (both multichain and native protocols)\nHow will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem?:\nCamelot strives to support the native ecosystem through collaborative relationships and has a proven track record of allocating incentives to facilitate sustainable growth and long-term liquidity for ecosystem protocols.\n\nThis proposal will focus on bringing new protocols into the Arbitrum ecosystem, promoting the adoption of $ARB as a base asset, and enhancing spot liquidity for Arbitrum native builders. This approach aligns with Arbitrum’s core values and aims to facilitate substantial and long-lasting growth.\n\nCamelot has achieved a total trading volume of >$3,250,000,000 and has maintained a TVL of over $50m for several months. Most importantly, Camelot’s ecosystem-focused approach has yielded impressive results which can be seen by the data below, which clearly shows how Camelot generates sizeable fees through its dynamic and sustainable approach to liquidity. Camelot’s strong focus on partnerships and bringing in new protocols has introduced pools such as $DMT, $WINR, $AURY, $PENDLE, and many more to Arbitrum. Additionally, concentrated liquidity integrations such as Merkl have allowed for highly efficient returns on blue-chip pools like ETH/USDC and ARB/USDC too.\n\nThrough this multi-faceted approach to liquidity, Camelot can continue to scale sustainable liquidity for Arbitrum, introduce new protocols to the ecosystem, achieve broader adoption for $ARB, and generate attractive but long-lasting fees for users too. These objectives, when combined, will bolster Arbitrum’s position as the leading L2 ecosystem for DeFi innovation.\n\nTo summarise, Camelot will foster growth and innovation on Arbitrum through liquidity incentives in several ways:\n\n50% of the incentives will be allocated towards partner pools and will be distributed using Camelot’s sustainable methodology that has achieved significant results\n20% of the incentives are allocated to $ARB, specifically to broaden its adoption as a base asset within partner token pools, increasing utility whilst incentivising growth\n20% to core pairs to establish highly efficient and deep liquidity on the native ecosystem trading venue, spurring network effects from protocols that leverage Camelot’s core pools (such as ALMs, yield protocols, lending markets and more)\nWith 10% reserved for new protocols, this grant will be used to attract new builders and protocols into the ecosystem, with Camelot acting as the natural entry-point for many teams. New projects will also receive our full marketing, community, and ecosystem support, in addition to any incentives.\nCamelot can support any token in a bespoke way - v3 pools can be incentivised with integrations such as Merkl and ALMs such as Gamma, achieving some of the most efficient AMM returns. V2 Pools are also still one of the most practical solutions for new teams and therefore partners can leverage our custom Nitro pool infrastructure.\nCamelot’s unique approach to concentrated liquidity will also allow for partner protocols to transition their tokens to more efficient rewards structures. Although v2 pools can be the most effective or practical option for long tail assets, we’re committed to supporting teams as they expand and deepen their overall liquidity on the chain.\nJustification for the size of the grant:\nCamelot is a top 3 native dapp by TVL and active users, and it has a proven track record of achieving sustainable growth, onboarding new protocols to the Arbitrum ecosystem, fostering collaboration, and distributing incentives in an effective way.\n\nAs shown in the table below, Camelot has a broad range of pools with varying liquidity profiles and requirements. Camelot can ensure that the requested $ARB incentives will be allocated in an objective and diverse way, in order to achieve deeper liquidity and efficient fee generation across numerous partner pools as well as blue-chip core pools.\n\nAs detailed in this application, Camelot has a multi-faceted strategy to achieve its objectives. To achieve these various objectives, different methods of distribution and incentivisation are required, and therefore the requested amount is justified by tackling the core points:\n\nExpanding Arbitrum by incentivising new partners and protocols\nIncreasing the adoption of $ARB as a base asset for native protocols\nFurthering the liquidity of $ARB and other core pools with the most efficient concentrated liquidity rewards structure\nDeepening liquidity for native builders, stimulating economic growth for ecosystem protocols\nThe below data (and document under ‘execution strategy’ displays Camelot’s ability to achieve sustainable liquidity and fee generation, even in periods of weak market conditions. This data combined with the diverse distribution of incentives will allow Camelot to achieve broad and long-term growth for the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\n\n\n900×700 30.1 KB\nExecution Strategy:\nAs mentioned throughout the application, Camelot will incentivise liquidity pools across several main categories, with pool-level granularity included in the below spreadsheets. This distribution is fully aligned with the detailed objectives and KPIs.\n\nCAMELOT GRANT ALLOCATION BREAKDOWN 217\n\nThe spreadsheet attached above provides an initial outline for the first epoch distribution. It is important to note that this is based on current market conditions and therefore specific pool allocations can be slightly adjusted before a finalized distribution is confirmed. Examples of these adjustments would include distributing incentives to a v3 pool instead of v2, or adding pools from new partners. The total amount per category won’t change.\n\nThe distribution of incentives will be reported at the end of every epoch (two-week period), and will include a pool-level breakdown of the key metrics (TVL, fees, volume, amount of incentives received) to accurately and transparently assess performance. This report will therefore determine the following epoch’s incentive distribution, to most effectively achieve the KPIs and objectives.\n\nCAMELOT GRANT EPOCH REPORT (example for reference purposes only, real data to be input once first epoch live) 22\n\nGrant Timeline:\nCamelot will begin distributing the incentives as soon as the tokens are received in the multisig. This will commence the first epoch (two-week period), with the mentioned reports and data being shared on an ongoing basis in-line with the timing of the following epoch token distributions to Camelot.\n\nThe distribution of incentives will be executed as per the allocation breakdown document on an epoch basis, and will continue for the 3 month period of the framework (At the latest up until January 31st 2024).\n\nDo you accept the funding of your grant streamed linearly for the duration of your grant proposal, and that the multisig holds the power to halt your stream?: YES\n\nSECTION 4: PROTOCOL DETAILS\nIs the Protocol Native to Arbitrum?: YES\n\nOn what other networks is the protocol deployed?: NONE\n\nWhat date did you deploy on Arbitrum?:\nBeta - September 2022\nMainnet - November 2022\n\nProtocol Performance:\n\nhttps://defillama.com/protocol/camelot 7\nhttps://info.camelot.exchange 4\nProtocol Roadmap:\nCamelot was initially launched as a complete product specifically to support Arbitrum builders and to provide the tools for more sustainable liquidity.

However, they only provide around a 12.78% APR and distribute dividends to their shareholders on a 3-month cadence.\n\nAll Weather: Providing a 19.63% APR at the time of writing and distributes dividends with every block, which occurs every 0.26 seconds.\n\nWeb3 Index Fund vs. All Weather Protocol:\n\nWeb3 Index Fund: Unlike Index Coop and Set Protocol, which only hold assets without incurring any impermanent loss, they also miss out on staking or farming rewards.\n\nAll Weather: Taking diversification a step further by integrating other defi protocols like SushiSwap, Pendle, Equilibria and Radiant Protocol. With an All-Weather portfolio, you not only enjoy token growth but also farming rewards.

With Forus, users consistently obtain funds through a fresh stealth address, preserving the utmost privacy in financial transactions Forus creates a fortified and confidential space, granting users the ability to receive funds discreetly through a quick , cheap and user-friendly interface.\n\nDescription\nWhen using Forus, you no longer have to be confined to a single wallet address. The issue with sticking to one address is that it can attract prying eyes. For instance, everyone knows that 'vitalik.eth' belongs to Vitalik Buterin. This opens the door to tracking his transaction history and potentially gaining insights into his financial activities. This situation might not sit well with some individuals, right?\n\nHere at Forus, you can bid farewell to the need for a personal wallet address. When you enter forus, simple generate a forus key (which is a cryptographic hash not related to any real blockchain address) make sure to securely store your forus key's private Key name as ""signature key"". Once you have your Forus key, share it with the sender. The sender will then craft a new address for you by doing some fancy math with your forus key , one that neither you nor the sender could predict. From then you dont need to send him any real wallet address he got your forus key when u would transfer you funds a new stealth address would be created on demand which you can control only.\n\nHow it Works\nThe receiver generates a new ""ForusKey,"" which is a one-time, base58 encoded address . Instead of sharing the personal wallet address, the receiver provides the Forus Key to receive funds.(Note : ForusKey is not bound to any blockchain address)\n\nThe receiver also generates a corresponding ""signature Key"" on demand, which serves as the private key for the Forus Key. This signature should securely saved for future use. (Note :Never share your signature Key with anyone always share ForusKey to receive funds)\n\nNext the sender generates a stealth address by doing some fancy math stuff with the receiver's Forus Key and sends funds to this new address. Also sender generates a public key on demand, and publishes it in a designated logs directory. This entire process is completed in a single transaction.\n\nThe receiver periodically scans the logs directory and perform calculations using his signature Key and the sender's public key. Through Diffie-Hellman key exchange, the receiver derives the private key for the stealth address on which the funds have been sent.\n\nWith the derived private key, the receiver gains control over that address on which the funds have been sent and can manage the funds received securely.\n\nIn summary Forus uses cryptographic algorithms and one-time-use keys that allow users to receive funds through addresses which are created by sender but controlled by receiver.\n\nWhy do u need Forus ?\nWhen people start poking into your transactions, they can act like detectives and piece together who you are and what you're doing. It's definitely not cool, right? It's like someone snooping around in your personal diary. But that's where Forus comes in, making sure that your financial stuff remains private\n\nWhat next for Forus ? Milestones\nForus is still under development .There are important things we need to work on before it's fully functional and user-friendly. Here's what we have planned.\n\n1.Making it more User-Friendly: We want to make sure using Forus is easy and intuitive. We'll improve the design, simplify processes, and make it more user-friendly.\n\n2.Adding NFTs: Forus is now limited to coins and tokens only, but we have plans in integrating anonymous nfts transfers too , would expand its capabilities and attract a broader user base.\n\n3.Testing and Auditing: We'll conduct thorough testing and audits to find and fix any issues. This is important to make sure Forus is reliable, secure, and stable.\n\n4.Deploying on the Mainnet and on other evm compatible blockchains : We would make Forus accessible and compatible with all main blockchain networks .\n\n5.Relayer feature: The relayer feature would be added to securely withdraw the funds to the user's personal address without giving the gas fee in native currency . Well forus also supports erc20 tokens but its not possible to pay in tokens.\n\n6.Adding Cool Features : We'll keep adding new features based on what our users want. This could mean more privacy options, support for different tokens, or integration with other cool apps.\n\n7.Cross-Chain Compatibility: As interoperability becomes more prominent, Forus could explore enabling cross-chain transactions. This would allow users to maintain their privacy while transacting between different networks.\n\nOur main goal with Forus is to make it easy to use while keeping your transactions private and secure. By working on these areas and making the necessary improvements, we hope Forus will become a trusted and widely used solution for private and secure transactions.\n\nAdditional Information\nFunding Sources\n\nMy personal savings plus we recently applied at gtc18 for funding .We have started out forus as a startup dont have any funding yet\n\nTeam Size\n\n2",Plurality Labs - Gitcoin Round

We are essentially allowing anyone ideally, with a web3 wallet to be able to access the platform and use infrastructure in the cloud all from their web3 wallet.\n\nHow the web3 and Arbitrum community can benefit 🚀\nA developer: AikiCloud can give Arbitrum/web3 developers and enthusiast more flexibility in how they access and use cloud resources. For example, anyone can use AikiCloud to rent cloud resources on a per-use basis, all from a web3 native wallet like metamask.\n\nAn NFT project: NFT art projects, often have the need to use infrastructure like stable diffusion servers and the likes, for image art generation, now it's possible to provision on from your wallet on the fly.\n\nWeb3 native user: We believe web3 users could have various needs for cloud services, for productive, educational or other purposes we haven't yet anticipate for, however as the need arises we can expand on our services and provision for their use case.\n\nConclusion 🚀\nAikiCloud is a promising project that has the potential to provide a number of benefits to the Arbitrum and broader web3 community. By reducing the friction to access cloud services, increasing flexibility, and improving scalability, AikiCloud can help Arbitrum developers to build and deploy better applications.\n\nAdditional Information\nFunding Sources\n\nself funded and public contributions\n\nTeam Size\n\n2",Plurality Labs - Gitcoin Round

One of the reasons is to reduce the transition cost for developers by adopting languages that developers have been using extensively, making it easier to onboard to Arbitrum.\n\nWELLDONE Studio aims to support Arbitrum in line with this goal. We have developed a plugin for multi-chains (WELLDONE Code) that allows smart contracts to be developed in Remix IDE for chains other than EVM. This is an official plugin for Remix IDE.\n\nWe currently support seven chains. In this process, we have contributed to supporting languages like Move and Rust in Remix IDE. Therefore, developing an environment in the web IDE where Arbitrum's Rust contracts can be deployed will be a very familiar task for us.\n\nWeb IDEs like Remix are crucial for initial developer onboarding. This is because, in Remix IDE, developers don't need to set up their local development environment at all.\n\nFor instance, in the case of the Sui Network launched earlier this year, 10% of all contracts were deployed through WELLDONE Code in the first half of the year.\n\nThis is the first project we are undertaking since our partnership with the Remix team. Through our contributions, developers will be able to easily develop Arbitrum contracts using Rust on the web, without the need for setting up a development environment locally.\n\nAdditional Information\nFunding Sources\n\nCurrently operating with internal funds and grants received from various blockchain foundations.\n\nTeam Size\n\n5",Plurality Labs - Gitcoin Round

Not all of the work I have been doing has been done in full view of the public, but my overall goal has been to find sustainable solutions for Arbitrum's on-chain liquidity environment, both for projects building on Arbitrum as well as for the $ARB token itself.\n\nThe research I have conducted led to the publishing of a 25+ page proposal by SushiSwap that was posted to the forums. Since then I have been actively involved in dozens of conversations with leading delegates and working groups about treasury diversification, on-chain liquidity acquisition, sustainable emissions, etc.\n\nI have grown very fond of the Arbitrum community and ecosystem and am extremely appreciative of this opportunity to potentially be recognized for the hundreds of uncompensated hours I have dedicated thus far.\n\nAdditional Information\nFunding Sources\n\nNot Funded\n\nHow long have you been working on this project ?\n\n6+ months\n\nWhat impact do you hope to have (or have had) on the Arbitrum ecosystem with your contribution?\n\nMy main goal in participating has always been to promote sustainable practices to the DAO. I have used my voice to raise concerns over flippant spending and have had dozens of discussions with delegates and working groups about these issues. I have advocated for POL for the DAO and builders on the network and have provided several detailed plans on how this can and should be achieved. I believe it is important for folks that go against the grain in terms of their thoughts on token emissions to have a chance to present their arguments in order to better shape the direction of the DAO.\n\nHow do you measure your impact? (e.g. viewers, forks, branches, likes, etc)\n\nI believe my impact is best measured by looking at the various working groups that have been formed to help push the DAO forward on multiple fronts. I have actively contributed to these working groups by bringing fresh perspective backed by thorough analysis. Despite not representing a protocol myself I have been a key player in the conversations surrounding the STIP, STIP backfund, and STIP round 2 - as well as being involved with the Treasury and Sustainability working group in terms of putting their theories and hypotheses to the test.\n\nHas this work been previously funded?

By speaking on behalf of no individual protocol being built on Arbitrum I am able to take an objective look at what is working well and what is not. The STIP has provided a ton of insight into some of the inefficiencies within the DAO due to its scale. Delegates are being forced to spend an unrealistic amount of time reviewing proposals that they are not necessarily qualified to review in the first place as it is not their particular area of expertise. I believe that my work within the DAO has helped bring clarity and I plan on furthering that through continued participation in DAO-wide discussions and pushing for optimization through the election of special committees or councils, etc.\n\nOnly individuals are accepted, are you a project or individual?\n\nYes",Plurality Labs - Arbitrum Citizens

My articles are mostly educational and have touched different aspects of Arbitrum: governance, tokenomics, projects building on it. One of my favourite article format consist in allowing all users to have a simple understanding of the technical updates happening in Arbitrum. Translating complexity into simple terms is fundamental to empower users to understand the key values, and unique proposition of Arbitrum.\nAll of my articles are also shared on Twitter as threads to increase their reach.\n\nExamples of articles include:\n\nhttps://fraxcesco.substack.com/p/on-arbitrum-governance-and-the-stip\n\nhttps://fraxcesco.substack.com/p/on-l2-security-and-the-trade-offs\n\nhttps://fraxcesco.substack.com/p/arbitrum-is-getting-more-decentralized\n\nhttps://fraxcesco.substack.com/p/how-to-create-your-l3-on-arbitrum\n\nhttps://fraxcesco.substack.com/p/arbitrum-in-2023\n\nhttps://fraxcesco.substack.com/p/an-introduction-to-arbitrum-governance\n\nhttps://fraxcesco.substack.com/p/making-defi-options-capital-efficient\n\nhttps://fraxcesco.substack.com/p/crypto-reinnassance-on-arbitrum-new-defi-protocols-are-super-impressive-15051328c718\n\nhttps://fraxcesco.substack.com/cp/103022559\n\nhttps://fraxcesco.substack.com/p/there-is-no-home-like-arbi-is-arbitrum-winning-the-layer-2-race-633b45cea3cf\n\nhttps://fraxcesco.substack.com/p/choke-driving-liquidity-innovation\n\nAdditional Information\nFunding Sources\n\n0x5820cC992b19947651D13663964A009748B0Cf94\n\nHow long have you been working on this project ?\n\nI have been contributing to the Arbitrum ecosystem since January 2023, but writing about it ever since it launched.\n\nWhat impact do you hope to have (or have had) on the Arbitrum ecosystem with your contribution?\n\nThrough my efforts as an analyst and researcher working with Castle Capital I have contributed in analyzing proposals on the Arbitrum Forum. In particular, as a collective we have commented on over 45 proposals, contributing to increasing overall awareness of the governance process as well as demanding accountability and transparency from grant recipients. By providing an unbiased opinion from a collective of on-chain native, we help projects align with their grassroot communities as well as with the overarching ecosystem goals of Arbitrum. Last but not least we hope to have encouraged smaller delegates and individuals to contribute and make their voice heard.\n\nWe have been very satisfied with our impact: over 35 projects engaged with us in the forum after our response. 21 updated their requests, including 14 projects who lowered their amount requested.\n\nIn total, our impact consists of more than 12m ARB saved that the DAO could allocate to other projects.\n\nFurthermore, both as an individual and through Castle Capital, I have written tens of threads and articles, who have contributed to increase awareness on the governance process, as well as to the Arbitrum tech stack and ecosystem, contributing to abstract technical complexity and educate/attract users to the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nHow do you measure your impact? (e.g. viewers, forks, branches, likes, etc)Public\n\nThe most immediate way to measure our governance impact is through the amount of ARB that we saved to the DAO following our comments: over 12m.\n\nFurthermore, over 50% of the projects we commented on updated their request. As our suggestions were mainly to ensure a broader alignment of the grant with Arbitrum, through our contribution we have acted as a steward of the ecosystem - even though this impact is rather non-quantifiable practically.\n\nThrough my research efforts, over 200k users (conservatively) have viewed and interacted with my articles and threads, both on Twitter and Substack. In this way, I have contributed to onboarding many new users, and educating them on Arbitrum.\n\nHow do you measure your impact?

With over 21 projects changing their proposals for the better, we have indirectly contributed to improving the overall governance process and making it more efficient.\n\nFurthermore, our contributions have held projects accountable for their request, initiating an open and public debate that benefits the ecosystem, helping everyone make better decisions on the issues at stake.\n\nThrough the creation of research reports, articles and threads, I have contributed to increasing users' awareness of the Arbitrum ecosystem, tech stack, and governance. Unbiased educational content also contributed in reducing user bias towards the chain, and to onboarding new users to the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nTogether, both of these contributions ensure Arbitrum is a more efficient and scalable system, making it future-proof.\n\nOnly individuals are accepted, are you a project or individual?\n\nYes",Plurality Labs - Arbitrum Citizens

As one of the earliest and most active users of JokeRace, I am well versed on how the platform works (and doesn’t work), including how to best incentivize the community to participate in governance through experimentation and gamification. \n\nProvide a summary of your intended program & the impact \nThe program, called “Our Biggest Minigrants Yet,” will consist of weekly JokeRace contests whereby ArbitrumDAO members decide which projects to award grants to during that particular week. Each week there will be a different theme for grant submissions, i.e. DeFi, web3 social, privacy tech, etc. to ensure funding is spread across the blockchain ecosystem. The impact of this program is a fully developed governance engine that Plurality Labs can use to fund future web3 projects.\n\nHow does your project meet one or more of our strategic priorities outlined above?\nThis project meets the second strategic priority outlined above: “Achieve governance optimization by identifying and iteratively improving key capabilities to increase DAO performance and accountability.”\n\nGovernance in large organisations like ArbitrumDAO can be disorganised and ineffective without structure and process. Properly incentivizing community members can be challenging. This program will develop and implement a weekly governance process through experimentation in order to fund worthwhile grants seamlessly and that will ultimately lead to better DAO performance and accountability. \n\nWhat impact does this have to the Arbitrum ecosystem? \nThe impact this will have on the Arbitrum ecosystem is a more engaged and higher quality community. By experimenting with various ways to make governance fun and properly incentivize participation, we strengthen not only the bond a community member feels to Arbitrum but also the bond a community member feels to other community members. The compounding effect of this over time is a stronger, more engaged, and more valuable community that is working together toward a shared goal (funding worthwhile web3 projects).\n\nHow do you plan to execute this program (Specification & Implementation)?\nOver the course of 8 weeks, we will run a contest on JokeRace each week with a different theme/topic to determine which projects will be awarded grants. Each week Plurality Labs will deploy 10k ARB to the top 4 projects ($2.5K ARB per project) voted on by the community. Anyone is able to submit proposals but only a council of around 100 of the most active and trusted ArbitrumDAO members, as well as winning grant recipients and their nominators, will be able to submit votes to ensure quality of projects chosen. Voting members will be pre-determined by the DAO.\n\nProjects will have an opportunity to respond to questions from the voting community as well, whether through a weekly livestream, ArbitrumDAO forum, or native JokeRace app (feature coming soon I believe).\n\nWhat are your Milestones?\nMilestone: ArbitrumDAO Voting Council elections held via JokeRace\nKPI: Around 100 successful candidates nominated and voted onto the voting council\nTimeline: December 11-20, 2023\n\nMilestone (ongoing): Weekly contests deployed on JokeRace to select projects to award grants to\nKPIs: 4 quality grants funded each week; at least 20% participation from the voting members each week\nTimeline: 8 weeks in early 2024 (January 8 - March 1, 2024) \n\nHow will the community validate impact?\nThe community will validate whether this work had an impact on the Arbitrum community by looking at the participation rates in each week’s JokeRace contest and the follow through exercised by each of the grantees. Ideally, we see governance participation increase week over week and an overall stronger and healthier culture develop at Arbitrum.\n\nFunding requirements\nWe are requesting 90,000 ARB for this project\n80,000 ARB deployed as grants, with 10,000 ARB deployed to 4 projects each week (2,500 ARB to each project) over the course of 8 weeks\n10,000 ARB to program manager (Diana Chen) to run this project, including setting up contests, managing communications and marketing to the community, and ensuring all KPIs are met\n	\nTimeline: \n80,000 ARB deployed as grants from January 8 - March 1, 2024\n5,000 ARB paid to program manager by February 1, 2024\n5,000 ARB paid to program manager by March 1, 2024",Plurality Labs - Direct

BlockScience is a digital infrastructure engineering firm with experience designing and analyzing blockchain networks across the domains of technology, economics and governance. Our governance research team has been in conversations with various Arbitrum Network Stakeholders and is apprised of active discussions in the Arbitrum Forum regarding the appropriation and allocations of funds to serve critical security, maintenance, and operational functions through engagements with expert service providers. Service providers need to be accountable to the public for both fulfilling those functions in a timely and expert manner, and communicating their activities. These are perpetual challenges associated with governing public infrastructures; some key concepts that can help improve governability are clearer separation between governance activities and operational activities, mapping out specific functions required for healthy ongoing operations and appropriating funds specifically for those activities independent of the service providers, and holding a distinction between activities which fulfill the expert functions and public engagement activities. \n\nBlockScience proposes to provide a public research brief on Aligning Expert Service Providers with Public Interests in Multi-stakeholder Networks. The brief will include an executive summary and a research article. The executive summary will address specific challenges and opportunities in this research area with direct tie-ins to active Arbitrum Governance Proposals. The longer research article will cover the following topics in greater detail, providing support for claims in the executive summary, and offering readers a clear path for the DAO to learn more about the subject matter. \n\nThe research article will include coverage of the following topics: \nDistinguishing between DAO governance and operations\nDecoupling appropriating funds for core functions from allocating funding to service providers\nDefining distinct but related roles for expert and public forums in a DAO\nAssessing context-appropriate incentives and accountability mechanisms\nIdentifying and managing non-financial resources such as attention, expertise and trust\n\nSuccess in this project will mean that Arbitrum Stakeholders will be able to have a more grounded discourse on this subject in the forums and the Arbitrum Delegates can make decisions about existing and future proposals with more confidence.\n\nThe output of this research is intended to be publicly communicated on the BlockScience blog and Arbitrum Forum, as well as relevant social media channels to communicate findings to as many Arbitrum Stakeholders as possible. \n\nHow does your project meet one or more of our strategic priorities outlined above?\n\nThis project aligns with Arbitrum's strategic priorities by:\n(1) contributing to governance optimization in a distributed setting through decision-oriented research on separating governance and operational activities, \n(2) promoting governor awareness and community growth by sharing findings on forums and social media, and \n(3) indirectly supporting the development of robust tools and resources for developers by providing insights into governance dynamics. This work will enhance the DAO's accountability, inform the community, and indirectly aid in the creation of effective DevRel tools, thus aligning with Arbitrum's overarching goal of sustainable scalability.\n\nWhat impact does this have to the Arbitrum ecosystem? \n\nThe proposed project has a significant impact on the Arbitrum ecosystem. It directly enhances the governance structure by providing insights and recommendations to distinguish governance from operational activities, allocate funds for core functions independently, and define roles for expert and public forums. This leads to a more accountable and efficient DAO, aligning with Arbitrum's governance optimization priority. Moreover, by sharing research findings and promoting awareness within the community, the project fosters a better-informed and engaged community, promoting meaningful community growth and reducing bias in decision-making, in line with another strategic priority. The potential broader impact lies in creating a template for effective governance and service provider alignment, which can be applied to other blockchain ecosystems, exceeding the scope of Arbitrum's strategic priorities and contributing to leadership in the broader blockchain space.  \n\nHow do you plan to execute this program (Specification & Implementation)?\n\n1.

Week 6: Publication and Distribution\n   - Compile adapted research, executive summary, and recommendations into a concise report.\n   - Publish the report on the BlockScience blog and the Arbitrum Forum, and engage in distribution strategy.\n\n   Deliverable: Final report, executive summary, and online publication.\n\nWhat are your Milestones?\nMilestones are ideally verifiable/measurable and related to impact.  In cases where this is not possible, please explain. \n\nMilestones are specifically around the production and distribution of the research document. Both of these activities may be evaluated both in terms of their initial reception, and their long term relevance and usefulness to Arbitrum stakeholders.\n\nMilestone 1: Production of the Research Document Draft\n- Completion of the draft research document\n- Evaluation through a peer-review-like process involving experts engaged in Arbitrum's governance optimization to assess its theoretical grounding and practical utility.\n\nMilestone 2 : Distribution and Community Engagement\n- Distribution of the final research document to the Arbitrum community via the Arbitrum Forum and other relevant channels.\n- Evaluation based on the level of engagement and feedback received on the forums, indicating its usefulness in enhancing the community's understanding of challenges and opportunities related to enlisting service providers in Arbitrum's operations.\n\nHow will the community validate impact?\n\nTimely delivery and distribution of agreed outputs.\nArbitrum stakeholders express interest in engaging further with BlockScience regarding the development of processes and practices which apply this research to Arbitrum governance optimization\nArbitrum DAO governors are well positioned to make informed, proportionate appointments of service providers to the DAO that are actionable, measurable, and accountable, in pursuit of the DAO mission, and within sustainable budget boundaries \n\nFunding requirements & timing \n\n-Project Initiation (upon grant approval): 32,534 ARB\n-Project Completion (estimated 8 weeks from initiation, noting 2 weeks for anticipated timing coinciding with the holidays): 32,534 ARB",Plurality Labs - Direct

This is useful for development processes and post-development needs like documentation and sharing smart contracts.\n\nAlthough, for this grant period, we'll focus on these post-development issues because of the fragmentation that developers experience while trying to interact with many protocol contracts.\n\nEtherscan's contract page is the primary way developers interact with smart contracts, and it only allows us to call one method at a time. So, to handle complex actions or workflows you'd have to write individual scripts. Plus, it doesn't contain sufficient documentation on the contracts. For example, executing a Swap action on Uniswap involves at least two calls for most tokens: approve tokens (approve), execute swap (transferFrom). Each workflow needs to be properly documented.\n\nAlso, etherscan does not allow simulation of their contracts. External developers would have to use hardhat or tenderly to pull the contracts on their own.\n\nWhen we look at the documentations of web2 technologies they allow you to read docs and call their APIs in the same place. While in web3, the documentation contains a list of verified etherscan contract addresses, and then sends developers to call the methods on the etherscan contract page. We want to merge documentation and calling the contract methods/complex actions into the same place.\n\nAlthough, few protocols like Compound have JS scripts (\n) on git to show developers how to use their contracts to perform popular complex workflows. You'd still have to clone it locally using hardhat to test it.\n\nOur goal is to enable developers to read the smart contract docs and call the methods/actions from the same place. As such, we've come up with these milestones:\nArbitrum Smart Contract Search Tool - A smart contract search tool to help find contracts for different protocols built on Arbitrum. Users will be able to read and interact with contracts on each protocol with all their contracts in a single place; including actions and documentation. It's open-source, so if a new protocol is introduced on arbitrum, they can add their protocol to the repo. This includes onboarding arbitrum’s developer community to the product.\nSimulation using a forked network. This way anybody can interact with smart contracts without the need to connect their wallet and pay gas fees to call the contract methods.\nAction/method widget that allows developers to call contract methods/actions inside an existing documentation (whether it's on docusaurus, gitbook, etc); without going to etherscan. We're also going to be opening PRs to add the widget to the docs of popular protocols like Uniswap, Aave, GMX, etc. Note that the widgets use simulation to make the calls.\nWhere are you heading with this grant?\nThis grant allows us to build relevant tools that eases devrel engineering (documentation and advocacy) and enables developers to interact with protocols and their smart contracts on the fly, without any grunt work.\n\nThis is just one step on our roadmap to contribute to the dev ecosystem, and demonstrate a clear use-case with everyday protocols. We’re going on to build out an entire suite of features to aid both development and post-development needs. You can find the concept here [redacted].\nWhat are your metrics of success?\nOur metrics during this grant period includes:\nDev community engagement across arbitrum and its different protocols. Both online and IRL communities.\nThe number of protocols we’re able to integrate with at the end of the grant period.\nOur metrics post-grant period includes:\nLaunch our beta version (v1) [redacted]\nConvert the exposure from the protocol integrations/documentation and community to more product adoption.\nExternal fundraising to boost growth\nTeam\nWe have hands-on experience building globally renowned web3 developer products such as \n (metamask & infura).

Grounded in our ""don’t trust, verify"" principle, we have created our own algorithm for collecting raw on-chain information allowing us to get the most reliable analytics data. Our goal is to allow everyone to do their own due diligence on DeFi projects based on impartial, comprehensive, and accurate data.\nIn which stage is the project currently at?\nDeFi Teller is fully functional and has been dedicated to providing blockchain analytics for nearly two years. We offer detailed dApp reviews and precise on-chain data, all of which we independently source directly from raw blockchain data, ensuring a fair comparison between projects, irrespective of their work logic. This service is available to our users absolutely free of charge.\n\nOur platform is recognized by users exploring the Arbitrum ecosystem. We're pleased to note that DeFi Teller appears in the top 10 Google search results for terms like ""Arbitrum dApps"", “Arbitrum projects”, “best Arbitrum projects” and ""best projects on Arbitrum"", among others.\n\nWhile we are mentioned alongside giants like DappRadar, DeFiLlama, and Alchemy, our defining difference is the combination of in-depth dApp reviews and direct blockchain data extraction, which ensures unbiased metrics like users, transactions, volume, and TVL.\n\nHere's a snapshot of our journey:\nDeFi Teller has been active and serving the DeFi community for nearly two years.\nOur focus has always been on providing accurate data directly from blockchains, accompanied by accurate and detailed reviews written by our researchers.\nAs we look ahead, our roadmap includes integrating new features and expanding our analytics capabilities to cover emerging trends and demands.\nWhere are you heading with this grant?\nWith this grant, we aim to fortify DeFi Teller's position as a premier analytics hub for the Arbitrum Ecosystem. Our objective is clear: provide users with the most comprehensive and reliable information about the Arbitrum ecosystem and enable the community to both use and contribute to this data. The grant will accelerate our efforts to refine our metrics and reviews, adapting to the evolving needs of the blockchain environment. In essence, our mission with this grant is to ensure that users consistently receive accurate, current, and trustworthy data.\nWhat are your metrics of success?\nMilestone 1:\nIntegration of the Arbitrum Nova dashboard into DeFi Teller.\nSuccessful calculation and display of historical data for main metrics.\nAvailability of both public and private APIs.\nImplementation of embedded charts and a CSV export feature.\nMilestone 2:\nUpdated dashboards with metrics for Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova.\nComprehensive metrics display for all projects within the Arbitrum ecosystem on DeFi Teller.\nMilestone 3:\nIntroduction of a wallet-connect feature, allowing users to leave reviews contingent on their interactions with the Arbitrum blockchain.\nTell us about the team… why you?\nThe DeFi Teller core team combines over four decades of collective experience in tech, marketing, and content creation.

Database Tools Enhancements:\n1.1 Integrate Arbitrum Nova.\n\nAdding support for projects launched on Arbitrum Nova to DeFi Teller will provide a transparent overview of their key performance metrics, such as TVL, transaction count, userbase, and volume. Our unique algorithm is designed to provide accurate and independent data on all projects, more details on how it achieves that can be found here.\n\nBeyond catering to researchers, integrating Arbitrum Nova paves the way for all the newcomers who have chosen us as their gateway to the Arbitrum world, helping them find the most suitable solution to their needs.\n\n1.2 Gathering Historical Data.\n\nOur aim is to gather comprehensive historical on-chain data across the Arbitrum ecosystem to accurately calculate ATH metrics for each project. To facilitate this we are reliant on being provided access to an archive node. If this is not possible and we need to set up the archive node ourselves, it will cost an additional $600.\n\n1.3 Public API.\n\nIntroducing a public API will grant free access to critical metrics such as TVL, volume, and user count, along with a list of contract addresses for each project from the Arbitrum Ecosystem featured on DeFi Teller. Beyond our user base, or projects wishing to showcase their performance, we're confident that this feature can greatly enhance the Arbitrum Portal by providing it with vital analytical data.\n\n1.4 Private API.\n\nLaunching a private API feature will enable authorized users to add contract addresses for on-chain data tracking. We aim to provide dedicated access to each team and dApp, allowing them to independently update their contract addresses.\n\n1.5 Embeddable Charts.\n\nIntroducing this feature, we aim to support anyone keen on showcasing on-chain metrics from our database on their platforms. Working hand-in-hand with the public API, it stands as another excellent enhancement for the Arbitrum Portal, visualizing the value across the Arbitrum ecosystem through our comprehensive metrics.\n\n1.6 CSV Export.\n\nOur free CSV export option targets those in need of historical data in a more hands-on format for their analysis or reporting.\n\n2. Comprehensive Analytics for the Arbitrum Ecosystem:\n2.1 Ecosystem On-chain Analytics.\n\nIn addition to monitoring the activities of projects within the ecosystem, we're keen on enhancing our Arbitrum dashboard page. This involves incorporating consolidated on-chain analytics for the whole ecosystem, which we'll further break down into specific metrics for Arbitrum Nova and Arbitrum One. We also plan to categorize and present analytics based on the nature of each project. Key metrics will cover TVL, volume, users, and transactions.\n\n2.2 Network Analytics.\n\nTo enhance the data we offer, we're planning to expand the Basic Info block for both Arbitrum Nova and One into a detailed network analytical dashboard for each chain. This update will feature TPS figures with a 24-hour average, and the average cost of token transfer transactions, both with historical data.\n\n3. User Feedback Enhancements:\n3.1 Wallet authorization.\n\nTo allow anyone to voice their opinion while also ensuring a transparent and resistant to manipulation ranking system we will introduce a wallet integration feature, facilitating data gathered by our algorithm.\n\n3.2 Review and Rating System.\n\nUpon passing the wallet authorization check, users will have the ability to leave in-depth reviews on projects they've interacted with and provide ratings. This system ensures that the Arbitrum Ecosystem is represented fairly, complemented by our trustworthy metrics, and our team’s official reviews. Thus, anyone conducting their due diligence will effortlessly access a diverse range of reliable resources.\n\nBudget Breakdown:\nProject Tasks: $9,920 for 248 Man-hours ($40/Man-hour) over 2 months.\nArchive Node Access: $600 for 1 month\n\nWebsite: \nX(Twitter): \nYouTube: \nLinkedIn:",Questbook - Dev Tooling on One and NOVA

What is the idea/project for which you are applying for a grant?\n\nLayer3 is applying for a grant as a result of feedback received in the proposal we put forward, BOOST, that recieved lots of excitement and attention, but ultimately did not pass. Feedback from notable delegates such as Griff Green, Disruption Joe, and L2Beat felt that BOOST was a perfect candidate to go through a Grant Program such as Questbook to prove a proof-of-concept and potentially come back to the DAO later with data around how a program might perform. So we are proposing miniBOOST! MiniBOOST aims to be immersive, instructive, and interactive, guiding new users to engage with Arbitrum, especially to understand the various applications that are participating in STIP.\n\nSTIP and incentives more broadly are valuable for short-term results, but they leave a massive gap when thinking about the long-term usage in an ecosystem. Our goal is to contribute to solving this problem through educational, engaging quests that create long-term Arbitrum users.Quests Definition:Quests are interactive learning modules that include informational visuals, quizzes, and multiple on-chain actions\n\nA simple application-level quest may include steps such as:\n\n- Learn about the mechanism behind AMMs and their evolution\n- Take a quiz on AMM basics\n- Make a swap on Uniswap\n\nQuests like these educate users on important aspects of the ecosystem with the goal of ensuring they become lifetime users of products on Arbitrum.\n\nThe project involves the design and deployment of 10 engaging quest learning modules, which introduce participants to leading Arbitrum applications, guide them to use these applications coherently, and lead them to discover the value and potential the Arbitrum STIP offers. The quests are designed to be completed both sequentially and individually, allowing users to participate at their own pace.\n\nOur ultimate goal with miniBOOST is to create a focused and data-driven approach to user education and engagement within the Arbitrum ecosystem. Through this grant application, we propose to develop a proof-of-concept by launching a concentrated series of interactive quests that introduce users to the various STIP participating applications, guiding them in utilizing these platforms effectively and comprehensively.\n\nBy implementing miniBOOST, we aim to demonstrate the long-term potential of such a dynamic learning-centric initiative in improving user acquisition, retention, and familiarity within the Arbitrum ecosystem. It's an initiative that not only fosters proficiency and understanding among users but also promotes broader participation and utilization of the Arbitrum-enabled applications.\n\nOnce we generate valuable insights and validate the approach with miniBOOST, Layer3 intends to present these findings to the DAO. The aim is to provide compelling evidence of the program's effectiveness and advocate for a broader implementation, ultimately contributing to Arbitrum's momentum, community engagement, and long-term success. This interactive and beneficial learning experience brings us closer to the vision of building an inclusive, vibrant, and engaged Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\n2. Tell us your plan of implementation for your idea/project.\n\na. Select Ten STIP Participating Protocols: We will carefully select 7 applications participating in the Short Term Incentive Program (STIP) and 3 not participating. This selection aims to ensure a diversified range of protocols are represented, providing a comprehensive educational experience for users across various digital applications within the Arbitrum ecosystem. Layer3 is open to input into which projects would be the best to feature.\n\nb. Design Interactive Quests: We will design ten unique, interactive quests that take users on a learning journey through each of the chosen applications. Each quest will provide step-by-step instructional content on the notable mechanisms that the protocols use, while offering practical insights and navigating users on how to use the application effectively.\n\nc. Beta Testing & Feedback: Before the official launch of each quest, we will conduct a round of beta testing with a small user cohort. This process is crucial in gathering initial feedback and making necessary adjustments to improve user experience and learning outcomes.\n\nd. Quest Launch: Once the quests from step 2 are refined based on feedback, we will launch a collection called, “Arbitrum Quests Presented by Questbook”. User engagement in each quest will be tracked to measure user response, completion rates, and overall interaction.\n\ne. Monitoring & Analysis: Throughout the launch, we will continually monitor user engagement and completion rates. We will provide Dune dashboards to measure this engagement and effectiveness throughout the program\n\nDashboard example here from our work with Rubic on Base: \n\nIterative Improvements: Based on the insights gathered, quests can be refined and improved even post-launch to ensure they continue to deliver an engaging and effective learning experience for users.\n\na. Target Audience\n\nLayer3 targets both new and advanced alike\n\nb. Expected metrics\n\nLayer3 expects MiniBOOST to generate 30,000 quest completions across 10 quests\n\nc. Is the project associated (or have plans to do it) with any organizations like, Universities, Institutions or Companies?\n\nN/A\n\n3. What is your estimated timeline for completion of the project?\nLayer3 expects to catalyze 30,000 quest completions within 1 months\n\n4. Outline the major deliverables of your project. See table below\n\n5. What is the size of funding you expect for completing each milestone of the project?\n\n$3,500\n\n6. Describe a budget and expenses. Also describe how much the contributors to the idea/project will be paid\nQuest Research: 1 individual * 30 hours * $25/hour = $750\nQuest Creation: 2 individuals * 50 hours * $50/hour = $5,000\nQuest Engineering: 2 individuals * 40 hours * $110/hour = $8,800\nInfrastructure and Maintenance: $8,450\nAdvertising and Promotion: $2,000\n\n7. Please identify the key milestones that will help track the progress of your grant.\n\nWe will deploy a Dune Dashboard with analytics on each of the quests and their total progress towards the 30,000 transaction goal\n\n8. Please map out your project milestones in the table below. These milestones will provide the Arbitrum community with progress updates of your project.\n\nMetric 1: 6,000 quest completions through Layer3, User Education, Dune \nMetric 2: 12,000 quest completions through Layer3, User Education, Dune \nMetric 3: 18,000 quest completions through Layer3, User Education, Dune \nMetric 4: 24,000 quest completions through Layer3, User Education, Dune \nMetric 5: 30,000 quest completions through Layer3, User Education, Dune\n\nWhile the milestones for this campaign is the quest completion metrics, we at Layer3 view our initiative from a broader perspective. Our long-term vision transcends immediate metrics as we see the immense value in growing and strengthening the Arbitrum community. We believe quests serve not just as an innovative advertising strategy but also as a powerful tool for user education, platform engagement, and community building. By participating in these quests, users gain more than just on-the-surface interaction with the platform; they acquire valuable knowledge and deeper experience, turning into active, well-versed members of the community. With each completed quest, we aim beyond the quantifiable impact; we are indeed fostering enduring relationships and contributing to the enriching growth of the Arbitrum ecosystem. We believe this qualitative approach is crucial for long-lasting and sustainable success.\n\nBenchmark milestones mark important points on the proposer’s roadmap for accomplishing their aim. E.g. our idea/project will get X users by Y date.\nThe Arbitrum collection will catalyze 30,000 quest completions by January 31, 2024\nCritical milestones demonstrate a good faith effort to achieve the objectives set forth in a proposal. Chain data or other publicly verifiable information is preferred for determining critical milestones. For example: ""We delivered X POAPs at the X event"".\n\nMetric 1: Launch the “Arbitrum Quests Presented by Questbook” Collection beginning with 4 quests\nMetric 2: Creation of Dune Tables\nMetric 3: Ship remaining 6 quests over 4 weeks\nMetric 4: Presentation of final deliverable data to the DAO\nSection 4: Impact\nHow does your idea/project align with the Arbitrum ecosystem?\nOur proposal aligns with the Arbitrum ecosystem by fusing in-depth education with immersive on-chain interactions. We aim to guide both new and advanced users across Arbitrum’s vibrant ecosystem while unlocking a greater, dedicated userbase.\nOur initiative aligns with Arbitrum's commitment to scalability, usability, and decentralization. By highlighting leading applications in the ecosystem, we hope to promote Arbitrum's robust architecture and vibrant developer community, ultimately enhancing its user base and reinforcing its position as the leading Layer 2 solution.\n\n2.

This can unlock broader ecosystem engagement and stimulate Arbitrum user growth.\n- Education and Advocacy: Through curated and interactive experiences, users gain greater understanding and confidence in using Arbitrum. Better-informed users can become advocates, further spreading the platform's adoption.\n- Feedback Loop: Active engagement with the Arbitrum ecosystem via Layer3 can also help surface greater user feedback. These insights can help Arbitrum's developers and project teams understand their user base better, thereby facilitating improvements, innovation, and evolution over time.\n\nIn summary, the initiative has the potential to boost both user adoption and platform development for Arbitrum, making it a catalyst for growth and innovation.\n\n3. How will your project contribute to the expected benefit of the based on the amount given?\n\nThe requested $17,500 will be key to realizing the project's potential. Here's a breakdown of the anticipated return on investment:Exploring Arbitrum Applications: The funds will be used to create and fine-tune the Layer3 Quests, ensuring they offer a comprehensive view of the Arbitrum ecosystem. This will result in increased knowledge and use of Arbitrum, contributing to growth and user retention.\n\nMarketing and User Acquisition: Part of the budget will be invested in strategic marketing to attract users to our Quest collection event. More Quest users will drive higher engagement for Arbitrum applications, thus contributing to Arbitrum's market position as a leading L2.\n\nCustomer Support and User Experience: To ensure user experience is smooth and rewarding, some funds will be used for customer support. Ensuring positive experiences can help accelerate the conversion of interested individuals to loyal Arbitrum users and advocates.\n\nFeedback Mechanisms: Constructing avenues for detailed user feedback will allow a better understanding of the user journey, hurdles, and preferences — providing integral data for the adaptation and evolution of Arbitrum.\n\nFuture Development: By assessing user participation and feedback from the event, we can plan further events with more targeted and comprehensive future Quests. We believe that these investments made from the allocated funds will enhance user participation, increase the user base, and ensure long-term Arbitrum loyalty.\n\n4. How should the Arbitrum community measure the success of this grant?\n\n- Sequencer Revenue: We will present an in-depth analysis of the sequencer revenue generated during the course of the grant period. This includes the total onchain transactions facilitated through our quests, the revenue these transactions created for sequencers, and the statistical relation between the quests and revenue development. This information is crucial to understanding the economic impact and effectiveness of our campaign.\na. Tx Fee Generated directly from quests\nb. Tx Fee Attributed (Using Spindl’s attribution method)\n\n- User Retention: The analysis will include an evaluation of user retention, showcasing the number of users who continued to engage with the Arbitrum applications after completing the quests. This includes repeat engagements, frequency, duration, and other meaningful user interaction metrics. These data will give valuable insights into the long-term success of our quests, beyond just initial completion.\n\nAdditional Metrics\n- Active Wallets\n- Wallets Attributed (Using Spindl’s attribution method)\n- Number of Transactions\n- Number of Transactions Attributed\n- Total # of Transactions Driven\n\nThe report will first be delivered to Questbook and then on the Arbitrum Forum for visibility.

During periods of growth, we swiftly recognized the necessity to update our infrastructure to accommodate the increasing number of players. Based on this, along with input from numerous sources, we concluded that the game necessitated a complete infrastructure overhaul. Fast forward to the present, we are nearing the completion of this reconstruction and redesign. We will be fully prepared to welcome hundreds of thousands of players into our ecosystem.\n\nCurrent Gameplay Walkthrough Link: **Note, we are currently undergoing a full overhaul, which will revamp the UI and game assets, and terrain/landscape**\n\nBlockchain Assets(NFTs)\nWe have multiple NFT collections upcoming for Gold Inc, from ownable equipment for mining, unique exploration skins, cosumable items, and more.\n\nMilestone Breakdown.\n\nMilestone 1: \nAlpha Beta Testing - Available for only selected testers, to do initial testing of our new infastructure for Gold Inc. \n\nMilestone 2:\nBeta Pre-Release - All features available for testing, with implementation of new designs. \n\nMilstone 3: \nApp Relaunch To Market - Full release to both the App Store and Google Play. \n\nQuick Links: \nWebsite: \nTwitter: @sapphireRDC @PlayGoldInc \n\nAddendum:\n\nOur plans involve the utilization of Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova.\nThe inclusion of Player Owned assets is a pivotal component of our ecosystem. We firmly believe that integrating with Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova will be essential for long-term sustainability and a seamless onboarding experience for players.\n\nWe have multiple methods for on-chain asset utilization, which will propel transactions within our marketplace and on Arbitrum/Arbitrum Nova:\n\nEcosystem Currency:\n\nGold Inc serves as the conduit for our currency, ""GXB."" Players will have the capability to convert the gold they mine in the game into GXB on the Arbitrum chain, scheduled to go live at Relaunch Milestone 3.\n\nBlockchain Asset Mints:\nIn our ecosystem, we have various mints planned, including cross-chain mints and chain-specific mints. Arbitrum and Arbitrum Nova will be instrumental in these minting processes.\n\nMarketplace:\nThe Sapphire Marketplace will house consumable items that can be purchased using GXB on the Arbitrum chain. This will drive significant transaction volumes for items that players may be acquiring daily or multiple times a day.\n\nConclusion:\nWe firmly believe that these three elements will stimulate substantial transaction volumes, aligning with our realistic goal of having hundreds of thousands of players by the end of 2024.\n\nDescribe your (or your team's) experience and background.\n\nOur technical team comprises four skilled Unity Developers and backend specialists, along with three talented designers. Together, we bring a wealth of experience, having successfully launched multiple games throughout our careers. Notably, ""Gold Inc"" was introduced in Early Access in 2021 as one of our key accomplishments.\n\nPlease provide images (or preferably video) of the current state of your project or game.\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1WfOTb4eINYDOXrW7r2lyM0qH_K-PJ1mw/view?usp=share_link\n\nWhat makes your project or game different than it's competitors?

(PSI). The first product we're building with the IP is a deep and forward-thinking roguelite deckbuilder RPG. The game is published within the Treasure ecosystem and is currently live in an early alpha stage. \n\nKaiju Cards is 2 things: a crypto-native IP universe, and the first video game title within that universe: a roguelite deckbuilder with mechanics drawn from squad RPGs and character collector games. \n\nThe game is currently in alpha and is live and f2p right now at \n. We recently ran the Pioneer Event in partnership with TreasureDAO. There were close to 800 unique players the game, over 3,000 NFTs minted, 22,600 runs played, and a solid community formed around the game. \n\nThe game logic itself is hosted on our game server, but characters are owned on-chain. When we implement our character leveling system, this will also occur partially on-chain via burning of specific NFTs/fungible tokens. \n\nThe game and IP have several intentionally crafted USP's:\n\n1. Art style that is stylistically different than most of the genre. Most of the art in this genre is dark (sometimes gritty) fantasy. We've taken a whimsical cartoon fantasy approach, flexing the skills of our animators from Adult Swim, Nickelodeon, and more. \n\n2. Tone of the game stands out within the genre. The game dialogue is often whimsical, absurd, and tongue in cheek. \n\n3. Unique and progressive game design. We're iterating on the genre by combining classic rpg class and party systems and synergies. This leads to a few key mechanical differences for players: \n- Depth of the combinatorics of the game. By isolating different archetypes of skills into cards, class passives, and characters, and siloing the pillars of the game mechanics into separate pieces, we've added more emergent gameplay to a genre which is already based our emergence. \n- Planning and experimentation. Because a user selects their party before a run starts, and the party composition dramatically affects all major mechanics (what you draft on your run, what class passives come with you, what your starting deck is), players can exercise a high degree of control over their builds, and can experiment with many different builds. \n\n4. An IP built for expansion. The Kaiju Cards IP is ready to be adapted into multiple other games, TV shows, merchandise, and more. This allows for community and IP expansion beyond our first game title. \n\nMap Update\n\nWe’re going to do a map code and art update, in order to transform the current hex map into a visually appealing and immersive world for players to explore.  Our current map code is some of the oldest in our codebase, as it was one of the earliest things we built.\n\nThis old code has several limitations, but the main one is we can’t put down “non-interactable tiles”, so only the playable tiles will show on the map. This is why the current map is floating on a sky background vs being grounded in-world with other tiles/art. We intend to refactor the code to allow various tile types, undertake an art overhaul to align with our art style, and make sure the new code is prepped to be integrated into Unity.\n\nTimeline:\n2-3 months (results will most likely be concurrent with the port to Unity, actual work will take 2 weeks or less)\nTotal funds requested: $10,000\nDevelopment: $7,500\nArt: $2,500\nThe map update includes:\nRefactoring map code for diverse tile types and paths\nArt overhaul to match our art style\nEnsuring scalability into Unity, our next major initiative\nUnity Port\n\nWe plan to transition to Unity from our current web-based framework. This switch will improve development efficiency and open opportunities for additional team members to contribute. We have 2 team members who can use Unity profieciently and are left out of the dev pipeline because of our current framework.\nThe transition involves a complete game server refactor and requires QA before launch.\nTimeline:\nTransition to Unity: 2-3 months\nQA: Several weeks (TBD)\nBudget:\nDevelopment and QA: $12,500\nPost-port internal training: $2,500\nUpon completion of the transition, we anticipate accelerated development cycles and the ability to experiment with game mechanics more efficiently. This allows us to run higher quality liveops more frequently, as well as get to our content goals much faster.\nDescribe your (or your team's) experience and background.\n\nThe following list is non-exhaustive but provides a window into our team. We’ve been together as a team for over 2 years and have shipped a fully on-chain idle game (Solana), a lootbox minigame (solana), and 3 different iterations of the Kaiju Cards game during that time. I (Mike) have 4 years of professional experience in the blockchain space as a web3 product and tokenomics designer. I, along with my PSI co-founder Josh, created the first-ever utility NFT's for DeFi protocol Strongblock in late 2020. These NFTs were simple (they boosted DeFi yield in different percentages based on rarity and attributes) but hinted at the future of utility that NFTs. This was the direct catalyst for forming PSI and getting into blockchain gaming. Josh grew up trading items starting at age 11 in Everquest, Runescape, WoW, CSGO, and many more games. He has also participated deeply in the MTG and Pokemon physical card economies. Our co-founder and creative director Tyler was a director at Adult Swim and a writer for both The Onion and Funny Or Die. He is also a well-known competitive 40k player and has a youtube channel dedicated to painting minis and tournament games. Our game economist Phil worked at Dice (EA), Scopely, and Prime Gaming. He was brought in to rescue the infamous Star Wars: Battlefront 2 fiasco. One of our game designers (not doxxed) has been at Blizzard for a decade and has spent most of his time there working on their most popular card game title. Our game dev Arya worked at USC to help make a new cat scan algorithm to more efficiently remove the skull from imaging. After that he worked in the Chinese airline industry, mostly dealing with the transfer of black box info between the airlines and the govt. Our game/blockchain/frontend dev Christian graduated from UT Austin in 2020 with a bachelor’s in Quantitative Finance. He had internships in investment banking (Nomura, NYC office) and asset management (TRS, $130B+ Pension fund) before working at PSI. Our tech artist and game designer Drew did motion graphics for Zynga and King for video game advertisements before working at PSI. Our marketing manager Kyle has been in digital advertising and content for well over a decade, having sold original content to National Geographic, showing work at festivals around the world, and doing music videos for the likes of Frank Ocean.\n\nPlease provide images (or preferably video) of the current state of your project or game.\n\nThe alpha can be played at https://play.kaiju.cards/.

An IP built for expansion. The Kaiju Cards IP is ready to be adapted into multiple other games, TV shows, merchandise, and more. This allows for community and IP expansion beyond our first game title.\n\nWhy are you building on Arbitrum?\n\n3 reasons: 1. As far as an EVM chain goes, the tech is incredibly solid, secure, and scalable. 2. Of all the L2's, Arbitrum has far and away the most amount of native $ETH bridged over. 3. The people. Not only are the Treasure core team and all game studio founders/staff great, but the Arbitrum Foundation gaming team is also incredibly responsive and supportive.

Our primary focus is growing the Arbitrum ecosystem by providing valuable, real time governance data and alerts to both existing users and potential new users.\nOur audience includes a broad spectrum, ranging from beginners interested in blockchain technology to developers, investors and the general public. We wish to provide information that's valuable to everyone and can help them stay informed within the Arbitrum ecosystem and promote transparency in governance.\nWe won the three latest blockchain hackathon in Paris, the Planq hackathon, the Comdex hackathon and the Innovation-X hackathon by NibiruChain with the product NiBID. Read more about our win : \n\nSection 2: Idea Roadmap/Milestones\n\nThe objective of this proposal is to create and deploy an analytics system deployed on socials such as Twitter, @ArbitrumGovernance, that monitors and reports activities on the Snapshot platform related to the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nThe Arbitrum Governance Tracker is designed to address the need for transparency and support participation in the governance process by tracking and summarizing governance proposals and discussions, the bot will provide community members with easy access to crucial information. We believe it will help users to stay informed about governance activity and actively engage in shaping the future of the network.\n\nThe bot's ability to reach a bigger audience through the socials will further promote awareness and involvement in Arbitrum governance. We are committed to have more community members become engaged in the governance process, so the network can benefit from a diversity of perspectives and ideas.\n\nFeatures & Functionality:\nActivity Tracking:\nProposal data: The bot will systematically track new proposals, encompassing details such as proposal title, description, creator address, submission timestamp and any associated metadata relevant to the proposal's nature or context.\n\nProposal status: Regular tracking guarantees that the bot stays updated with proposals that are in progress, quickly adjusting to any modifications or updates in proposal specifics as they arise.\n\nVote tracking: The proposed vote tracking system involves the bot posting updates when a delegate with over X votes casts a new vote on a proposal. This could be done by retweeting the original proposal tweet with the updated data to bring more visibility. The information displayed would ideally include the voting address, any associated ENS and later, the Twitter handle. The system would also present the amount voted and the voting stance.\n\nVoting results: Once a proposal concludes, the bot will extract and disseminate a thorough report on the results, divulging the number of votes in favor, against and whether any quorum requirements were met.\n\nActivity alert : If there is a significant amount of activity on a proposal, the bot will post an alert on Twitter to inform users.\n\nTweeting Mechanism:\nThe bot's tweeting mechanism is engineered to distill complex governance data into succinct and informative tweets, providing the community with accessible summaries.\n\nProposal tweets: For new proposals, the bot's tweets will be comprehensive, featuring the proposal title, detailed description, creator identity and a direct link to the Snapshot page for a deeper exploration.\n\nLive voting updates: During the voting phase, the bot will issue timely tweets offering updates on voter turnout, any noteworthy developments and encouraging community members to participate actively.\n\nOutcome announcements: For concluded proposals, the bot's tweets will spotlight the final results, underlining whether the proposal passed or failed and elucidating any pertinent consequences or implementations.\n\nScheduled Updates:\nAggregated data: Scheduled updates will not merely present isolated pieces of information but will aggregate data, such as the total number of new proposals, ongoing votes and recently concluded proposals.\n\nDevelopment:\nTwitter API integration: The integration with the Twitter API will be fine-tuned to handle the dynamic nature of real time data update.\n\nSnapshot API: The Snapshot tracking will be architectured ensuring the retrieval of a diverse range of data from the protocol. It guarantees that all relevant information about proposals, votes and outcomes is captured with precision.\n\nUnit testing: The development process will include unit testing, validating not only the accuracy of data extraction but also the bot's ability to generate informative tweets.\n\nHosting infrastructure: The bot will be deployed on a secure hosting platform equipped with scalable resources, making sure it can handle potential surges in governance engagement without compromising performance.\n\nRegular updates and maintenance routines will be scheduled to adapt the bot to changes in the Snapshot or Twitter APIs and to introduce new features based on ongoing user feedback.\n\nWe plan to complete the project within five weeks.\nOur main deliverables are V1 of the bot on Telegram and V2 of the system on Twitter. During the development, the team and community will be invited to test and provide feedbacks of the analytics system to make changes and add more data if needed.\nOur budget will cover developer compensation, hosting renewals, maintenance and server costs. Specific payment details for contributors will be outlined in the budget proposal. Funding requirements for each milestone will be detailed in the proposal.\n\nSection 3: Impact\n\nHow does your idea/project align with the Arbitrum ecosystem?\n\nThe analytics system promotes transparency by tracking and summarizing governance proposals and discussions, making it easier for community members to stay informed about the governance process. The Tracker encourages participation by providing easy access to information about governance proposals and discussions, supporting community members to engage in the process. The system also supports the decentralized nature of Arbitrum by making sure that control over the network remains in the hands of its users.\n\nHow will your project contribute to the expected benefit based on the amount given?\n\nThe system will make it easier for community members to stay informed about governance proposals and discussions. This will help to build trust and encourage participation in the governance process. The bot will support the decentralized nature of Arbitrum by providing a platform for community members to share information and perspectives about governance. This will help to ensure that control over the network remains in the hands of its users.\n\nHow should the Arbitrum community measure the success of this grant?\n\n• Retweet and like count\n• Community engagement rate (quoted, replies, sharing @ArbiGovernance, talking about the bot)\n• Number of Twitter followers\n• Accuracy of displayed data\n• Speed of Arbi Governance to display a proposal\n• Follower growth rate (from month to month)\n• Conversion rate from followers to active participants (maybe later on we can add a tracker that counts how many voters participated in governance through a ArbiGovernance link)\n\nIn the long term, how will you continue to contribute to the Arbitrum ecosystem?\n\nBeyond the immediate project scope, the @ArbitrumGovernance Twitter system is seeking long-term contribution by continuously evolving to meet the changing needs of the community, adapting to new governance structures within the Arbitrum ecosystem and eploring additional features and integrations.\n\nWe will actively explore other opportunities to support the Arbitrum ecosystem, whether through partnerships, educational initiatives or other innovative projects that further the growth and development of Arbitrum. Our vision is one of sustained, long-term collaboration with the Arbitrum community!\nTelegram\n\n@SHAYSUL",Questbook - New Protocols and Ideas
https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stella-final-stip-round-1/17328,"SECTION 1: APPLICANT INFORMATION\n[Provide personal or organizational details, including applicant name, contact information, and any associated organization. This information ensures proper identification and communication throughout the grant process]\n\nApplicant Name: Apoorv Anand\n\nProject Name: Stella\n\nProject Description:\nStella is a leveraged yield farming protocol on Arbitrum with 0% cost to borrow. Stella enables leveraged strategies on top of capital efficient yield sources like Uniswap DEXs, TraderJoe liquidity book, and the Pendle PT pools, with integrations with Camelot V3 and Penpie coming soon.\n\nThe innovation about Stella is that it offers 0% cost to borrow, and leveragoors only pay a portion of their profitable positions upon closing. If the position is not profitable, the leveragoors do not have to pay any borrowing cost. The model is beneficial for lenders as well since their incentives are aligned with the leveragoor, and their upside is uncapped in market scenarios where leveragoors have more profitable positions.\n\nTeam Members and Qualifications:\n\nTascha : Founder, Project Lead\nNipun : Founder, Tech and Research Lead\nArin : Product Lead\nBlum : Growth Lead\nApoorv : BD and growth team\nProject Links: [Enter Any Relevant Project Links (website, demo, github, twitter, etc.]\n\nWebsite : https://stellaxyz.io/ 54\nDemo : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F3rr3FsbK4&ab_channel=TraderJoeXYZ 3\nGithub : Stella · GitHub 1\nTwitter : https://twitter.com/stellaxyz_ 28\nDiscord : https://discord.stellaxyz.io/ 1\nContact Information\n\nTG: @apoorv99\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/stellaxyz_ 28\nEmail: [apoorv@stellaxyz.io]\nDo You Acknowledge That Your Team Will Be Subject to a KYC Requirement?: Yes\n\nSECTION 2: GRANT INFORMATION\n[Detail the requested grant size, provide an overview of the budget breakdown, specify the funding and contract addresses, and describe any matching funds if relevant.]\n\nRequested Grant Size: 186k ARB\n\nGrant Matching: NA\n\nGrant Breakdown: [Please provide a high-level overview of the budget breakdown and planned use of funds]\n\nStella has two parts to it: Stella Strategies (the leveraged strategies part) and Stella Lend (the lending pools on Stella). The 186k ARB of incentives will be distributed between the two parts as follows:\n\n~66K ARB as incentives deployed on Stella Strategies\n\nStella will provide additional 20% yields for leveragoors on top of their profitable positions.\nThe additional incentive will only be provided on profitable positions, not on unprofitable positions. This will help protect from sybil attacks and incentivize good behavior.\nStella currently runs a similar ‘leveragoor incentive’ program by providing 20% additional yields on profitable leveragoor positions.\nExtrapolating numbers from Stella’s previous ‘leveragoor incentive’ program to the Arbitrum STIP program, we expect to achieve a target TVL of 3M by utilizing ~66k ARB tokens in incentives.\nThe detailed derivation and breakdown of numbers is shared in the ‘Section 3’ of the proposal under ‘Justification of grant size’.\n~120K ARB to use as incentives deployed on Stella Lending pools\n\nStella currently offers 3-10% APY in real yield on popular lending pairs.\nStella is launching the LST-based PT strategies on top Pendle (live on 29th Sept), and Penpie (live on Oct 3rd). Due to this, we expect a surge in ETH pool utilization. Additionally, Stella will add support to many strategies using ETH and USDC as quote assets, thus increasing the utilization of the ETH and USDC pools.\nStella needs an additional ~2-5% in lending APY on these assets to be more competitive and help bootstrap initial liquidity. Once the liquidity is there on the lending side, leveragoors will be able to open more positions, which will translate into higher (and sustainable) organic APY for lenders. This will offset the need for more lending incentives in the future.\nBased on historical data, a TVL of $5M is needed on the lending side to support $3M of leveragoor TVL.\nTo achieve the additional 5% APY, we would need to utilize ~120k ARB in incentives over the period of 14 weeks.\nThe detailed derivation and breakdown of numbers is shared in the ‘Section 3’ of the proposal under ‘justification of grant size’\nAny remaining funds by 31st Jan 2024 will be returned back to the Arbitrum DAO.\n\nFunding Address: 0x2e39FbB069aCcD1959D003297250129879eb20A1\n\nFunding Address Characteristics: A 2/3 multisig with private keys securely stored.\n\nContract Address:\nContract address is yet to be determined, but we will be doing Cumulative Merkle Drop Mechanism (similar to how 1inch does it : https://github.com/1inch/merkledistribution/blob/master/contracts/CumulativeMerkleDrop.sol 2)\n\nSECTION 3: GRANT OBJECTIVES AND EXECUTION\n\n[Clearly outline the primary objectives of the project and the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) used to measure success. This helps reviewers understand what the project aims to achieve and how progress will be assessed.]\n\nObjectives: [Clearly state the primary objectives of the grant and what you intend to achieve]\n\nThe primary objectives are :\n\nAttract more DeFi users to Arbitrum by offering leverage on real yields :\nStella stands out as a leveraged yield protocol in the DeFi space with the unique ‘0% cost to borrow’ offering. This unique value proposition allows ~70% of the leveragoor positions on Stella to be profitable with +600% APY on average - much higher than counterparts. The levered real yields through Stella would help attract DeFi native users and sticky liquidity to Arbitrum.\n\nBring access to leveraged yields on various assets with unique integrations :\nStella intends to bring access to the highest yields in the ecosystem on a variety of assets by offering leverage on top of unique integrations. Stella is the only place on Arbitrum to leverage LP into Uniswap V3, TraderJoe Liquidity book or Pendle AMM. Through these multiple integrations, Stella offers yields on assets like ETH, ARB, Stables, LSDs and protocol tokens like RDNT, HMX, PENDLE, GMX etc.\n\nStrengthen liquidity pools for innovative protocols :\nStella has listed leveraged LPing strategies for several innovative protocol token pairs like HMX/ETH, RDNT/ETH, PENDLE/ETH, GMX/ETH etc. These strategies in turn contribute to up to 10% of the underlying DEX pool TVL, helping increase the depth of the pool. Also, since leveragoors on Stella take an average leverage of 3X, leveragoors will bring in 3X the liquidity in these pools using Stella, compared to if they had directly LPed into the DEX pool. Stella is also building on top of Camelot V3 as well to support more Arbitrum native protocol token pools, and strengthen liquidity for those pools.\n\nWe believe that the above points will help enable the ultimate goal of making Arbitrum as the main L2 to access leveraged LP strategies and increase the liquidity in DEXs.\n\nKey Performance Indicators (KPIs): [Specify the KPIs that will be used to measure success in achieving the grant objectives]\n\nThe following are the KPIs and metrics that should be achieved by the end of Jan 2024 :\n\nProtocol TVL - Reach $6M in TVL (235% increase from now)\nTotal Positions - 4,000 leveraged positions on Stella (135% increase from now)\nNew Strategy Listing - List 1 new leveraged strategy per month on the integration partner protocols towards the end of Jan 2024\n% of Strategy TVL of underlying DEX pools - Contribute 10% of the total TVL on the underlying DEX pools\nProtocol users - 300 monthly active users (MAU) on Stella\nCumulative leveragoor real yield - $120,000 cumulative real yield earned by leveragoors on Stella (140% increase from now)\nFeel free to check current statistics on Stella Analytics page: Stella 5\n\nHow will receiving a grant to enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem?: [Provide details]\n\nThere are 4 ways we see this benefiting the Arbitrum ecosystem :\n\nGo-to yield source on Arbitrum :\nStella is providing leveraged LPing on blue chip protocols like Pendle, Uniswap V3, and TraderJoe V2. Stella will enable up to 10X leverage on LSD token-based Pendle PT pools, enabling highest yields on Arbitrum ecosystem for DeFi users. Stella’s unique ‘0% cost to borrow’ model enables ~70% leveragoors to be profitable, which is much higher than counterparts. This will in turn benefit existing users on Arbitrum, and attract DeFi degens onto Arbitrum.\n\nBootstrapping liquidity for innovate Arbitrum Native protocol tokens :\nOne of Stella’s focuses is to increase the liquidity for the Arbitrum native token pools. This is especially important to facilitate more activity to the Arbitrum native protocols. Stella currently supports up to 10% of the TVL of the underlying DEX pool for Arbitrum protocol pools like Radiant (RDNT/ETH), Pendle (PENDLE/ETH) and HMX (HMX/ETH). Stella also plans to integrate with Camelot V3 to support leveraged LPing on top of the pools of Arbitrum native protocol tokens.\n\nBetter liquidity in the DEX pools, lower price impact :\nIncentives on Stella Strategy will help attract more liquidity in the Stella strategies, which in turn will increase the liquidity in the underlying DEX pools. Since leveragoors on average take a 3X leverage on Stella, they bring 3X the volumes in the underlying DEX pool, compared to if they had directly LPed into the DEX pool. The increased volume in the DEX pools enable low price impact swaps for the community. With the ARB incentives and high leverage strategies, Stella will be able to provide the highest yields for these pools.\n\nLending opportunities for Arbiturm Native tokens :\nStella works closely with Arbitrum partner protocols to list their tokens on the lending side, and help bootstrap liquidity. This allows the token holders to earn passive yields by lending their tokens, increases ecosystem utility of the tokens, and in turn reduces sell pressure. Some popular Arbitrum protocols with lending pools include Pendle (4.1% organic APY), Radiant (5.8% organic APY), HMX (11% organic APY), JOE (8% organic APY), GMX (4.7% organic APY) etc.\n\nJustification for the size of the grant: [Enter explanation]\n\nWe will break down the justification into two parts : The justification on grant size and the justification on Stella being the right candidate for this grant.\n\nJustification of grant size :\nThe requested liquidity incentive is needed in this size since Stella would need to incentivize both the strategy and the lending side to get the flywheel started. Choosing to incentivize just one side would inhibit the scaling process.\n\nTo share the derivation of the exact numbers of the Stella Strategy and Stella Lend :\n\nStella Strategy :\nStella currently runs a similar ‘leveragoor incentive’ program by providing 20% additional yields on profitable leveragoor positions. Given the incentive program will run for 14 weeks, we expect incentives worth ~$52.8k to achieve a target TVL of 3M assuming the ‘incentive supplied to TVL achieved’ ratio will remain the same. At $0.8 per ARB token, this translates to ~66k ARB.\n\nStella Lend :\nStella needs to reach a target TVL of $5M on the lending side to support $3M in leveragoor TVL. A 5% APY on a TVL of $5M over a duration of 14 weeks translates to roughly $96.4k in incentives. At $0.8 per ARB, this translates to ~120k ARB.\n\nJustification on Stella being the right candidate for this grant :\nStella is the most capital efficient yield source on Arbtrum offering the highest leverage. Stella offers unique integrations to CLAMMs and Pendle AMM and Arbitrum Native token pairs.\nStella is an Arbitrum native yield protocol. We have invested in providing the most secure and sustainable source of yields for the Arbitrum community, including getting multiple audits from the likes of Peckshield, Trust etc.\nExecution Strategy: [Describe the plan for executing including resources, products, use of funds, and risk management. This includes allocations for specific pools, eligible assets, products, etc.]\n\nThe execution strategy can be divided into the following :\n\nKPI Tracker : Set up the data dashboard for the community to continuously keep track of the efficacy of the incentives deployed. Efforts to build out this tracker will be kickstarted as soon as the grant is approved, and will be live by mid November (in time for the first bi-weekly update).\n\nRisk Management : Stella only lists strategies that cross our robust risk management framework. The framework includes listing blue chip project tokens, relying on robust price feeds only (like Chainlink), listing pools with high enough TVL etc. On the Stella Lend side, we ensure liquidity and safety of pools by putting in borrow caps by evaluating on a pool by pool basis.\n\nCommunity updates : The Stella team will provide bi-weekly updates of the incentive program in the forum thread, and would be responsible for answering any questions from the community.\n\nDisbursement of funds : This section includes details on allocation of funds, pools, and mechanism of distribution.\n\nAllocations of funds :\n66k ARB will be directed towards incentivizing the Stella strategies, while 120k ARB will be directed towards incentivizing lending pools on Stella Lend. A detailed breakdown of these numbers has been shared in Section 2 above.\n\nDisbursement mechanism :\nThe ARB incentives given to the leveragoors through Stella strategies will not be directly distributed, but rather will be auto-deposited in the ARB lending pool on Stella and would be with linear vesting over 30 days. This would prevent immediate dumping of ARB tokens, and will also allow leveragoors to earn additional “lending yields” for the next 30 days. On the lending side as well, this would help bootstrap liquidity in the ARB lending pool.\n\nAllocation for pools :\nOn the Stella strategies side, all the profitable leveragoors get the additional 20% incentives regardless of the strategy/pool. On the lending side, the incentives will be distributed on a per dollar basis regardless of the pool. Since we expect higher TVL in the ETH and USDC pool, we expect a higher % of the incentives going towards those assets.\n\nGrant Timeline: [Describe the timeline for the grant]\n\nApplication/Review/Voting: October 11, 2023\nGrant Administration / KYC Period: Late October 2023\nDistribution contract finalization and Deployment Period: Late October 2023\nIncentive Program Begins (with biweekly updates): November 1, 2023\nIncentive Program Ends: January 31, 2024\nFinal Report: February 15, 2024\nDo you accept the funding of your grant streamed linearly for the duration of your grant proposal, and that the multisig holds the power to halt your stream?

This helps reviewers understand what the project aims to achieve and how progress will be assessed.\n\nObjectives:\nTo introduce & encourage users on Arbitrum to a new DeFi primitive that enables secure Oracle-less lending\nTo enable deeper liquidity and higher capital efficiency for ARB & ETH markets on Timeswap, thereby introducing Oracle-less lending to new set of users\nTo enable deeper liquidity for high quality collateral that cannot be listed on other money markets - Assets from following protocols - Pendle, GMX, Trader Joe etc\nEnable credit to otherwise underserved markets (e.g., long-tail assets, staked assets, LP tokens, etc.) in a secure and scalable manner\nKey Performance Indicators (KPIs):\nTVL for incentivised pools\nLend and Borrow volume for incentivised pools\nUser acquisition rate for incentivised pools\nComparables of the above versus non-incentivised pools\nHow will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem?\nTimeswap is a new DeFi primitive for credit markets (i.e., money markets). We create money markets that operate without the need for oracles or on-chain liquidity, due to our non-liquidatable and fixed-term design enabled by our unique 3-variable AMM\n\nThis provides us with the unique ability of creating secure and scalable money markets for any assets(ERC-20 or ERC-4626). By any, we mean any — we are not restricted by oracle support for the asset, which is a major blocker for asset listing in oracle-dependent money markets.\n\nMoney markets in itself unlocks capital, boosting capital efficiency and bringing additional utility to tokens. By incentivising deep liquidity in Timeswap pools, not only are users secure from oracle manipulation attacks but it also enables large transactions, leading to greater overall capital efficiency. The strongest benefit of a capital efficient protocol/ecosystem is its ability to scale quickly.\n\nBy incentivising the main pools (ARB and ETH markets), a trickle down effect to other markets already live on Timeswap (e.g., Pendle’s PT-GLP, StaFi’s rETH, TraderJoe’s sJOE, WooFi’s weWETH, etc.) will begin. Thus indirectly boosting capital efficiency across our partner protocols and the greater Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nJustification for the size of the grant:\nTimeswap has been live on Arbitrum since March 23, 2023 and have supported the creation of money markets for over 20 assets, mostly which could not be listed elsewhere due to oracle dependencies and liquidity requirements. More information on the listed assets can be found in the ‘Protocol Performance’ segment , under Section 4.\n\nTimeswap will match the approved grant size with $TIME tokens, all to be used as incentives for the approved pools.\n\nThe grant will allow Timeswap to scale by creating money markets for new assets and deepening our existing markets.\n\nExecution Strategy:\n100% of the allocations will be used for liquidity mining incentives to be distributed to end users during the proposed period from Oct ‘23 to Jan ‘24\n\nA summary of the distribution:\n\n40% of the grant allocated as incentives to ARB markets.\n30% of the grant allocated as incentives to ETH markets.\n30% of the grant allocated as incentives to other markets.\nDuration (days)	Allocation (%)\nARB market (Oct’23 - Jan’24)	90	20.0\nARB market (Oct’23 - Dec’23)	45	10.0\nARB market (Dec’23 - Jan’24)	45	10.0\nETH market (Oct’23 - Jan’24)	90	15.0\nETH market (Oct’23 - Dec’23)	45	7.5\nETH market (Dec’23 - Jan’24)	45	7.5\nOther markets*	-	30.0\n*Other markets includes Pendle’s PT-GLP, TraderJoe’s sJOE, GMX’s ETH GM, etc.\n\nThe non-ARB/ETH markets to be incentivised will be shared in the bi-weekly reports and subject to comments/feedback from the community.\n\nFor efficacy purposes, incentives to the non-ARB/ETH markets will only be allocated to markets where the underlying assets is a governance/LP/receipt token of an established project, as per the discretion of the community. (Will not be allocated to TIME token pool)\n\nThe incentives will be fully distributed no later than January 31, 2024.\n\nAny ARB incentives not distributed will be returned to the Arbitrum DAO.\n\nGrant Timeline:\nUsers who are eligible for ARB rewards from the eligible pools will be able to claim their rewards on the following dates in the dedicated rewards section on the app. Rewards section will also mention how much TIME tokens has been earned on top of ARB rewards from the qualifying pools.\n\nNovember 20, 2023\nDecember 20, 2023\nJanuary 20, 2023\nDo you accept the funding of your grant streamed linearly for the duration of your grant proposal, and that the multisig holds the power to halt your stream?\nYes\n\nSECTION 4: PROTOCOL DETAILS\nProvide details about the Arbitrum protocol requirements relevant to the grant.

The activity will include driving on-chain contributions through Arbitrum protocols that reward users with ARB directly through Galxe’s Token Reward module.\n\nARB will go directly to the participating users to reward them for their efforts and contributions in each protocol.\n\nDevelopment for our Token Reward module on Arbitrum is already complete, so Galxe can begin our ARB incentives program immediately following the passing of the proposal.\n\nFunding Address:\n\n0xeF80A06933Ad67F16a234e10693B2f935e4a9130\n\nFunding Address Characteristics:\n\n2/5 multisig with private keys securely stored.\n\nContract Address:\n\n0xeF80A06933Ad67F16a234e10693B2f935e4a9130\n\nSECTION 3: GRANT OBJECTIVES AND EXECUTION\n\nClearly outline the primary objectives of the project and the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) used to measure success. This helps reviewers understand what the project aims to achieve and how progress will be assessed.\n\nObjectives:\n\nGalxe looks to achieve many objectives with this grant. Our primary focus is to continue supporting Arbitrum’s ecosystem as a resource for Arbitrum dapps to reach new global audiences in addition to being a tool to reward and manage current community members.\n\nThis grant will enable Arbitrum dapps to do the following:\n\nDrive new user growth\nReward their current community\nGamify their engagement through a variety of different ways\nBuild out their own on-chain loyalty program on Arbitrum\nCreate their own web3 Arbitrum CRM\nOn the other hand, Arbitrum users will have the ability to do the following:\n\nFurther build out their identity/reputation on Arbitrum via on-chain contributions\nCurate anon-chain resume\nDiscover each of the excellent protocols that Arbitrum has to offer\nEducate themselves on the Arbitrum ecosystem\nAdditionally, we expect the incentives to assist Galxe in furthering our mission of Arbitrum ecosystem growth. Arbitrum protocols have the incredible opportunity to engage with Galxe’s millions of users through ARB incentives.\n\nKey Performance Indicators (KPIs)\n\nConsidering each campaign can request users to perform multiple on-chain actions, our most conservative estimate is that we will drive ~1.5M transactions throughout this incentive program\nWe expect this to help our Arbitrum ecosystem partners to execute additional Galxe campaign modules on top of the Token Rewards campaign, such as Arbitrum OAT and NFT mints\nGalxe has also observed the need for a stronger NFT presence and greater utility for NFTs within the Arbitrum ecosystem. Based on the below screenshots, we believe Galxe OAT is an excellent solution and has the best opportunity to impact the Arbitrum ecosystem in a positive way. Galxe OAT is proven to be the best solution for dapp developers to leverage in community building.\n\nGalxe looks to fulfill the following objectives and help Arbitrum become a leader in the NFT space.\n\nIncrease NFT asset transaction volume on Aribtrum\nAssist developers in deploying NFT contracts on Arbitrum via Galxe’s no-code dashboard\nGrow unique NFT holders on Arbitrum\nAmplify secondary marketplace trading on Arbitrum\nScreen Shot 2023-09-27 at 11.39.37 PM\n\nScreen Shot 2023-09-27 at 11.40.13 PM\n\nSource: https://arbitrum.nftscan.com/ 1, https://optimism.nftscan.com/\n\nFurthermore, should Galxe receive this grant, we will commit ourselves to integrating an Arbitrum OAT.\n\nBNB OAT 3 (deployed in 2021)\n\n8.6M+ minted\n1M+ unique holders\nPolygon OAT (deployed in 2021)\n\n21.3M+ minted\n2.2M+ unique holders\nTop erc-721 contract on Polygon\nAvalanche OAT 1 (deployed end of March 2023)\n\n3.1M+ minted\n657K+ unique holders\nOptimism OAT 1 (deployed end of May 2023)\n\n1.8M+ minted\n479K+ unique holders\nKey Performance Indicators (KPIs) for an Arbitrum OAT:\n\n20 Arbitrum native dapps deploy an Arbitrum OAT within 3 months.\n20 non-native Arbitrum dapps deploy an Arbitrum OAT within 6 months.\n250K total Arbitrum OAT mints within 3 months.\n400K Arbitrum OAT mints within 6 months.\nTo be clear, the ARB incentives will only be used for Arbitrum protocols running Token Reward campaigns on Galxe that incentivize on-chain activity on Arbitrum. An Arbitrum Galxe OAT is not part of the requested grant, but we will commit to integrating it as an additional growth supplement to our Token Reward module and for Arbitrum protocols to seamlessly reward their community members with a gasless badge.\n\nHow will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem?:\n\nAt Galxe, you’ll attract and engage users from other ecosystems Galxe has worked with that Arbitrum may not have had the chance to interact with yet.\n\nThis grant enables Galxe to leverage our community of 12M unique users to explore and engage with Arbitrum’s top protocols through ARB incentives.\n\nThrough Galxe credentials, Galxe makes sure only valuable, loyal contributors are getting rewarded. We look forward to maximizing our existing resources at hand to ensure maximum success and growth for Arbitrum is achieved.\n\nAt Galxe, with our experience and resources, we’ve accumulated the following accomplishments.\n\nAn ecosystem of over 3700+ web3 projects\n40K+ campaigns & quests powered\nGalxe has over 60M+ NFTs minted directly through our platform, generating ~ $15M worth of gas fees on all supported chains\nTwitter of over 1M+ (Verified)\nDiscord with 555K+ members\nAll Arbitrum dapps will continue to get strong Galxe support and guidance on running growth campaigns.\n\nWe believe that our proposal is directly in line with the goals of the framework in the “Motivation” section on Arbitrum’s STI Program to “Support Network Growth” and to “generate maximum activity on the Arbitrum network.""\n\nGalxe will be supporting Arbitrum network growth in a variety of ways.\n\nOnboarding a global network of existing and new users to Arbitrum via Galxe campaigns and quests\nA resource for Arbitrum dapps to grow their protocol and manage their communities through ARB incentives\nMost importantly the requested grant will assist Galxe in powering transaction fees in three different ways across the following activities.\nDrive transaction fees across the network through user interaction with each protocol. At times, users may be asked to complete multiple on-chain activities within one campaign to become eligible for ARB rewards.\nGenerate transaction fees when users claim their ARB rewards following verified eligibility\nNFT minting fees on Arbitrum generated via Galxe quests for users to mint their reputation badges\nGalxe plans to make this program inclusive so any quality Arbitrum protocol in need of ecosystem development can become eligible to incentivize users with ARB. ARB incentives for each protocol will depend on their Space Tier and campaign structure.\n\nAt this time, we’re planning on working with the following protocols to kick this program off.\n\nGMX\nTrader Joe\nXAI\nSushiSwap\nVela Exchange\nRadiant Protocol\nCamelot\nConnext\nMagpie\nWooFi\nStargate\nHop\nFrax Finance\nSavvy DeFi\nChronos\nClipper\nApeSwap\nNotional\nLido\nThales\nPancakeSwap\nAside from Galxe’s Token Reward module, Arbitrum protocols can leverage Galxe’s additional gamification modules for other initiatives. The screenshot below is meant to represent the simplicity and easiness of deploying an Arbitrum Token Rewards quest.\n\n\n1370×886 86 KB\nJustification for the size of the grant:\n\nGalxe is looking for a grant of 500,000 ARB that will go directly towards incentivizing and rewarding participating users in Arbitrum campaigns only. The grant is justified by the activity we expect to see in the quests based on our prior experience working directly with the Arbitrum ecosystem and our 12M unique user base looking to explore the Arbitrum ecosystem. Over the past 90 days, the average number of monthly user actions taken on Galxe is 16.3M, and this tells Galxe that users are eager to explore and power activity on-chain. through Galxe campaigns. No part of the grant will be kept by the Galxe team.\n\nAny unused funds will be returned to the Arbitrum DAO on January 31, 2024.\n\nExecution Strategy:\n\nOnce the grant is received, the Galxe team will begin to work with our network of Arbitrum partners on execution. The strategy will be focused on working closely with those Arbitrum partners to engage global audiences, incentivize protocol engagement, identify valuable contributors, and reward contributors with ARB through Galxe’s Token Reward module.\n\nGalxe will begin marketing the initiative following the passing of the proposal.\n\nTo prevent any abuse of the incentivizes from protocols, Galxe recently introduced our new Space Tiers, representing a dapps ranking within Galxe.\n\nFor context, Space Tiers on Galxe gives a partner more availability/access to additional promo support/features among other things that a Lower Tier Space would not have access to. Higher Space Tiers can be achieved by a project’s commitment to running quality campaigns on Galxe consistently. Space Tiers ensures only the highest quality dapps are eligible for the incentives. Galxe plans to leverage our Space Tiers program in determining which Arbitrum Galxe partners are eligible to use the ARB incentives in their Token Reward module campaign. Space Tiers 3 and 4 will be eligible to begin with.\n\nThe objective of the Space Tiers system is to incentivize long-term usage of Galxe’s infrastructure while unlocking special perks/benefits along the way, such as gas fee credits, promotional opportunities, priority support, etc.\n\nIf you reference the below screenshot, Galxe has a clear blueprint of how a Space can level up within Galxe. Our Task Center within each project’s dashboard is designed to guide you through each tier to understand what is necessary to level up.\n\nGalxe will make sure to incentivize quality Arbitrum Token Reward module deployments and participation by including it in the Task Center for each relevant Tier. There are two distinct ways that Galxe can encourage Arbitrum activity amongst our 3700 ecosystem partners within the Galxe Task Center.\n\nReward dapps that deploy steady Arbitrum Token Reward Quests.\nReward dapps that achieve consistent, high-level participation.\nTo make sure the grant funds go into the hands of humans AND are used to drive on-chain transactions on Arbitrum, a minimum requirement to receive the token rewards grant will be to define at least 1 on-chain action and add a Sybil prevention credential. Galxe will enforce the usage of a Sybil prevention credential throughout this program.\n\nGalxe Passport: 3 Galxe’s own KYC solution. This method allows only real, verified users to participate in Galxe campaigns. Galxe Passport has 446K+ verified users and verification is conducted by Persona.\n\nGalxe Web3 Score: 5 Prove your humanity via off-chain and on-chain verification.\n\nGitcoin Passport: Dapps can token-gate their campaigns with a customized Gitcoin Passport Score\n\nTrusta Labs Sybil Scoring Credential: A credential that assigns a Sybil score based on wallet history/activity using AI tech.\n\nNomis Score: Analyzes wallet activity across multiple EVM chains.\n\nHave X amount of transactions on Arbitrum: A wallet must have a minimum amount of transactions on Arbitrum\n\nHold X amount of ARB or ETH: Hold a specific number of ARB or ETH tokens in your wallet\n\nScreen Shot 2023-09-27 at 11.41.29 PM\n\nTo make it clear, achieving an increased Space Tier on Galxe is not related in any shape or form to profits that Galxe may accrue. Our Space Tier Program is determined by the quality of campaigns, the willingness to experiment with Galxe’s entire suite of growth tools and the consistent, steady use of Galxe’s infrastructure.\n\nYou can also find more info here on Galxe Space Tiers. https://help.galxe.com/en/articles/7549545-galxe-space-tier-program-rewards-and-benefits-for-platform-contributors 2\n\nLastly, Galxe will not take any portion of the funds. Funds will be used for the sole purpose of incentivizing and rewarding users with ARB through Galxe’s Token Reward module.\n\nGrant Timeline:\n\nGalxe plans to begin working with Arbitrum ecosystem dapps immediately following the passing of the proposal. This includes finding the best activity to track and incentivize that is relevant to each protocol\n\nAny unused funds will be returned to the Arbitrum DAO on January 31, 2024.\n\nDo you accept the funding of your grant streamed linearly for the duration of your grant proposal, and that the multisig holds the power to halt your stream?\n\nYes.\n\nSECTION 4: PROTOCOL DETAILS\n\nProvide details about the Arbitrum protocol requirements relevant to the grant. This information ensures that the applicant is aligned with the technical specifications and commitments of the grant.\n\nIs the Protocol Native to Arbitrum?:\n\nNo, Galxe is a multi-chain protocol that is the leading platform for building web3 communities.\n\nOn what other networks is the protocol deployed?:\n\nGalxe supports NFT minting functionality on the following networks.\n\nArbitrum, Ethereum, Avalanche, Polygon, BNB, Optimism, zkSync, OKX, Fantom, Moonbeam, Solana, IoTeX, Sei, Linea, Base, Polygon zkEVM, Flow, Injective, Manta Network.\n\nWhat date did you deploy on Arbitrum?:\n\nJune, 2022.\n\nProtocol Performance:\n\nGalxe has been contributing to the Arbitrum ecosystem for over 12+ months. Our most recognizable contribution within the Arbitrum ecosystem has been The Arbitrum Odyssey.\n\nThe Odyssey kicked off in the summer of 2022 with the objective of shining a spotlight on Arbitrum protocols in addition to driving Arbitrum ecosystem growth. By leveraging Galxe’s growth tools, community, and advisory, Arbitrum attained stellar growth.\n\nThe first two weeks of the Arbitrum Odyssey 1 achieved the following metrics.\n\n423,309 Arbitrum NFTs minted\nBrought 300,000 unique users to Arbitrum\nBridged over $40 million worth of assets to Arbitrum\nThe Arbitrum Odyssey has just resumed after pausing initially due to network congestion and Arbitrum’s awaited upgrade to Nitro.\n\nGalxe played an essential role in helping Odos 2 boost its community, increase trading volume, and achieve long-lasting retention. Through Galxe, Odos was able to identify its most valuable contributors. Furthermore, Odos could segment its traders of all types and backgrounds via Galxe credentials.\n\nOdos’ Galxe campaigns achieved the following metrics in less than 90 days. Its Arbitrum campaigns on Galxe saw the most engagement.\n\nIncrease from $6M to $9.4B+ in cumulative trading volume across its supported networks\n3.1M+ total swaps\n91K+ unique users\n900-163K+ Twitter follower growth\nCase Study. 3\n\nGalxe has also been working closely with Offchain Labs’ Xai. Galxe has played a significant role in onboarding users to the Xai ecosystem. Throughout this quest, Xai has been able to achieve off-chain and on-chain growth from a variety of users. Alongside this activity, Galxe has been a resource for amplification.\n\nLastly, Galxe also saw immense success and overwhelming participation in the Linea Voyage, co-hosted by Galxe and Linea (ConsenSys zkEVM).\n\nThroughout the 9 week quest, Galxe contributed to the stellar growth of Linea’s testnet. Galxe saw the following.\n\n5.2M+ unique addresses participated in the campaign\n826K+ participants verified themselves as real humans\n50M+ testnet transactions were completed throughout the duration of the campaign\nCheck out the Linea Voyage 1 here.\n\nOver the past 90 days, Galxe has accumulated the following growth metrics.\n\n12M unique users\nThe average number of actions taken on Galxe in a 90-day period: 16.3M\n2.57M+ Discord handles registered with Galxe ID\n3.56M+ Twitter handles registered with Galxe ID\nGalxe’s infrastructure and growth tools have also been used to propel Optimism’s development from Fall 2022 through January 2023. This four-month quest demonstrates Galxe’s ability to power sustained growth over a lengthy period of time.\n\nThe Optimism Quest achieved the following results. Galxe studied data from pre-30 days Quest to post-30 days Quest to understand its powerful impact.\n\nCase Study. 1\n\n47.7% growth of Optimism usage\n23.3% aggregate growth across all participating protocols\n276.9% transactions increase for Granary\n\n1404×788 123 KB\nGalxe was directly responsible for driving an average of 374,824 Optimism transactions per day during the Quest\nEach participating Optimism protocol saw incredible growth in new active addresses\n\n1406×802 113 KB\n\n1418×798 75.9 KB\nSource: Dune\n\nGalxe is an expert at powering protocol growth and guiding users to explore different protocols. During this quest, there were no incentives available to users throughout its duration. We are thrilled to see the results when there are incentives included.\n\nAll Arbitrum protocols will be eligible to receive an incentive subsidy to kickstart their own growth via Galxe. Galxe’s Arbitrum partners have deployed 160 Arbitrum quests over the past three months. Using the requested ARB funds this will be the most inclusive questing incentive program known to the blockchain space rather than incentives only being available to select Arbitrum protocols.\n\nAll Arbitrum protocols will have the opportunity to use the ARB incentives in their Galxe campaigns. Galxe will leverage our Space Tiers to determine the subsidy amount.\n\nThis grant will kickstart and sustain ecosystem growth across the entire Arbitrum ecosystem. Currently, Galxe is the highest traffic driver on Arbitrum over the past 30 days. The main purpose of this grant is to increase traffic and give Arbitrum protocols a resource for growth via incentives.\n\n\n1418×1504 264 KB\nNo other quest platform has contributed more to protocol ecosystem development than Galxe.

https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/lodestar-finance-final-stip-round-1/16981,"UPDATE (23 OCTOBER 2023)\n\nIn order to separate the DAO’s Treasury from the Arbitrum STIP distribution, the following address arb1:0xfA62A3A0722a0aF7739c23a361E2285F5B75ecE7 will be used to receive and distribute the ARB incentives, set as a 3/4 multisig.\n\nThe Lodestar team’s KYC process is ongoing and we look forward to seeing this grant program unfold.\n\nSECTION 1: APPLICANT INFORMATION\nimage\nimage\n1500×500 29.4 KB\nApplicant Name: Lodestar Finance DAO (“the DAO”)\n\nProject Name: Lodestar Finance (“the Protocol”)\n\nProject Description: A native Arbitrum-centric money market\n\nTeam Members and Qualifications: Appo (Smart-contracts), Quanta (Operations), Coopes (Back-end), Waffle (Growth)\n\nProject Links: lodestarfinance | Link3.to 55\n\nContact Information\nTG: @waffleapeven\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/WaffleApe 28\n\nEmail: dev@lodestarfinance.io (cc: waffle@lodestarfinance.io)\n\nDo You Acknowledge That Your Team Will Be Subject to a KYC Requirement?: Yes\n\nSECTION 2: GRANT INFORMATION\nRequested Grant Size: We are requesting 750,000 $ARB tokens from the Short-Term Incentive Program.\n\nGrant Matching: These incentives will be overlaid on our regular incentive schedule, 300 000 LODE tokens being emitted to the markets every month (200,000 starting december).\n\nPlease refer to LODE - Docs 6 for additional information.\n\nGrant Breakdown:\n\n95% of the grant (712 500 ARB) will be distributed among all market participants (the term “market participants” refers to depositors and borrowers in the Lodestar markets and does not include LODE liquidity providers or stakers). Each market participant is entitled to proportional ARB rewards based on the ETH value of their deposits and borrows relative to the ETH value of all deposits and borrows. See “Execution Strategy” in Section 3 for additional information.\n\n5% of the grant (37 500 ARB) will be distributed among all emission gauge participants, proportionally to their voting participation.\n\nIn the interest of the protocol’s security, we will distribute ARB incentives weekly as an airdrop as the protocol does not have an innate ability to emit tokens other than LODE.\n\nWe are dedicating 100% of this grant to incentives as we have also applied to an Arbitrum Foundation grant to support our operational and security expenses.\n\nUPDATED FUNDING ADDRESS: arb1:0xfA62A3A0722a0aF7739c23a361E2285F5B75ecE7 (separate address from the DAO Treasury)\n\nPrevious Funding Address: 0xed093F9720B2507C9B54FC117ecB2618910734dd (CANCELED)\n\nContract Address: N/A\n\nSECTION 3: GRANT OBJECTIVES AND EXECUTION\nObjectives: We aim to use the funds from the grant to incentivize depositing and borrowing activity in the Lodestar Markets and the participation to our emission gauge to shape the protocol.\n\nBy providing depositors with more attractive yields and borrowers with cheaper borrow interest rates, we expect these incentives to improve the general available liquidity in the lending markets. This will allow users to deploy their assets more efficiently, but also support Protocols that are facilitating leveraged yield-bearing strategies such as looping with wstETH or plvGLP in an even more effective way.\n\nKey Performance Indicators (KPIs):\n\nWe believe that the main KPIs to measure the success of the grant are:\n\nTotal Value Locked (“TVL”):\n\nGrowth in the total deposits on the Protocol\nGrowth in the total deposits of yield-bearing assets\nUser Count:\n\nTotal number of weekly users\nTotal amount of staked $LODE and vote participation\nWe also believe that there is value in tracking the utilization rate of Lodestar Finance. Growth in the utilization rate would imply competitive interest rates, trust in the Protocol and desirable assets.\n\nHow will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem?:\n\nBy offering an alternative destination for tokenholders to deploy their native application tokens, we will be able to support applications in:\n\nAllowing native yield-bearing assets to be even more competitive with assets in other ecosystems by virtue of the leveraged looping of these assets;\nRetaining a larger user base and tokenholder population; and\nReducing supply-side pressure on their token which supports their Protocol’s growth and adoption.\nWe also believe that these incentives will introduce users to our unique emission gauge system that empowers users and DAOs to shape the money market.\n\nBy lending or borrowing on Lodestar, users receive LODE tokens that they can stake to earn ETH from the protocol’s revenues.\n\nAdditionally, every week, those who lock their LODE can vote and direct the next week’s emissions to the market of their choice, on either the borrow or supply side. Since its launch 4 weeks ago, we have witnessed LODE lockers shaping the protocol, enhancing their yield strategies by incentivising either the borrow side to lower the cost of their leveraged strategies or increasing the interest gained on the supply side to increase the yield they are generating.\n\nWith the increased liquidity from these incentives and the composability of our markets, we look forward to seeing other developers build on top of the Lodestar markets and participate in the above mechanics to shape the liquidity to their needs.\n\nJustification for the size of the grant:\n\nAs per the Forum post, the Arbitrum Working Group has created four grant categories with advisory caps implemented on them. Lodestar Finance currently falls into the Siren Grants category having launched in Apr-2023 (5 months ago) with c.$14m in deposits. We believe we lie at the higher end of this category by virtue of almost being on the threshold for the next categorisation, the Lighthouse Grant. Moreover, we have also spent long periods of time above the TVL threshold to fall into the next category.\n\nWe also note that we have reached this scale without having been a recipient of the ArbitrumDAO airdrop demonstrating our ability to compete with other protocols for liquidity.\n\nExecution Strategy:\nLodestar plans to distribute the granted funds through the following process:\n\nMarket and gauge participants will be compensated directly with $ARB tokens for their participation in the protocol.\n\nEligible rewards are proposed to be calculated in the following manner:\n\nThe amount of $ARB tokens distributed weekly will be the total amount of $ARB granted divided by the number of weeks until the incentive program stops in January 2024.\nTwo snapshots will be taken each week, one during the first half and one during the second half. The timings of the snapshots will not be publicly disclosed to prevent users from gaming the rewards system.\nFor each protocol user, weekly $ARB distribution is calculated by taking the sum of their total supply and borrow balances (in $ETH) and dividing by the Protocol’s total supply and borrowed balances (in $ETH).\nThe user’s final weekly eligible rewards will be the average of eligible rewards between snapshots.\nA third snapshot will be taken at the end of the epoch to calculate the users’ voting power and participation\nThe user’s calculated eligible rewards will be airdropped directly to their wallet.\n\nThe Lodestar team will monitor the distributions each week and create ways to report useful metrics to the public.\n\nGrant Timeline:\n\nWe plan to deploy the incentives over a period of 16 epochs until the end of the campaign in January 2024 (4 months):\n\nWeek 1 - October 22nd: 46,875 $ARB airdrop\n\nWeek 2 - October 29th: 46,875 $ARB airdrop\n\nWeek 3 - November 5th: 46,875 $ARB airdrop\n\nWeek 4 - November 12th: 46,875 $ARB airdrop\n\nWeek 5 - November 19th: 46,875 $ARB airdrop\n\nWeek 6 - November 26th: 46,875 $ARB airdrop\n\nWeek 7 - December 3rd: 46,875 $ARB airdrop\n\nWeek 8 - December 10th: 46,875 $ARB airdrop\n\nWeek 9 - December 17th: 46,875 $ARB airdrop\n\nWeek 10 - December 25th: 46,875 $ARB airdrop\n\nWeek 11 - December 31st: 46,875 $ARB airdrop\n\nWeek 12 - january 7th: 46,875 $ARB airdrop\n\nWeek 13 - January 14th: 46,875 $ARB airdrop\n\nWeek 14 - January 21st: 46,875 $ARB airdrop\n\nWeek 15 - January 28th: 46,875 $ARB airdrop\n\nWeek 16 - February 4th: 46,875 $ARB airdrop\n\nDo you accept the funding of your grant streamed linearly for the duration of your grant proposal, and that the multisig holds the power to halt your stream? Yes\n\nSECTION 4: PROTOCOL DETAILS\nProvide details about the Arbitrum protocol requirements relevant to the grant. This information ensures that the applicant is aligned with the technical specifications and commitments of the grant.\n\nIs the Protocol Native to Arbitrum?: Lodestar Finance is native to Arbitrum and has not expressed any interest in deploying on any other blockchain.\n\nOn what other networks is the protocol deployed?: n/a - Lodestar Finance does not have any deployments on any other blockchains\n\nWhat date did you deploy on Arbitrum?: Lodestar Finance launched on Arbitrum in April 2023.\n\nProtocol Performance:\n\nLodestar Finance is a money market deployed natively on Arbitrum. The money market aims to provide first-class infrastructure to native Arbitrum assets such as MAGIC and GMX, as well as blue-chip assets in the Ethereum ecosystem. It has also found a niche by facilitating money markets for yield-bearing assets including those native to Arbitrum such as plvGLP and wstETH.\n\nIt is governed by the Lodestar DAO and is 100% community owned and funded. With c.$14m in deposits today, Lodestar Finance is still the largest native money market on Arbitrum. At its peak, Lodestar Finance had over $50m in deposits, showcasing the desire for our product within the ecosystem.\n\nFurthermore, the $LODE token has demonstrated positive value accrual with the Protocol earning c.$90k fees since launch. After the launch of the staking module, the Protocol commenced distribution of a portion of market revenue, with approximately 40% of the circulating supply staked, earning an average 35% APR paid in ETH.\n\nThe Lodestar Protocol also became one of the first money markets to implement an emissions gauge to direct incentives to deposit and borrow pools, enabling user-driven dynamic market emissions. To date, the emissions gauge is currently in its fifth weekly epoch.\n\nIt is also worth noting that the Lodestar DAO was not a recipient of the ArbitrumDAO airdrop as the protocol was offline from December 2022 to April 2023. This meant that the Protocol was competing with other incentivised protocols for liquidity and still maintained positive growth in less than favorable market conditions.\n\nDune Analytics Dashboard: https://dune.com/shogun/lodestar-finance 14\nDefillama Dashboard: https://defillama.com/protocol/lodestar-finance 6\n\nProtocol Roadmap:\n\nThe introduction of the weekly gauge system to our staking module empowers stakers in shaping the money market. We envision protocols, DAOs and users building vaults and individual strategies on top of Lodestar Finance, stockpiling their $LODE emissions earned to give them more control over the destination of future emissions.\n\nStaking $LODE tokens presents a two-fold advantage for third parties using the protocol. First, they have the potential to earn a real yield from the application’s revenue, denominated in WETH. Second, and equally significant, is their ability to direct emissions. This mechanism has been envisioned to produce a reinforcing cycle: as stakers reap the benefits of yields and have a say in emission directions, it logically follows that they could accumulate a larger quantity of $LODE tokens.\n\nCurrently, discussions are underway with several protocols that are leveraging the Lodestar markets and infrastructure to build new and interesting products such as automated strategies or utilizing our yield-bearing assets in novel ways. These protocols can also take part in the emissions voting system to enhance the yields for their own products.\n\nAdditionally, development efforts at Lodestar have been focused on building a module and interface for a protocol bribing system. This system aims to provide benefits for all participants in the Lodestar staking and emissions voting systems. LODE stakers will be able to earn a yield on their available voting power and bribers can channel increased amounts of emissions voting power to their preferred strategies.\n\nAudit History :\nLodestar V0 was audited by SourceHat (formerly known Solidity.Finance) and crowd audited in partnership with Hats Finance before our launch in April:\n\nSourceHat (formerly Solidity Finance) - Smart Contract Audit Services\n\nLodestar Finance Smart Contract Audit by SourceHat (formerly Solidity Finance) 1\nSourceHat (formerly Solidity Finance) has audited Lodestar Finance.

This is the recommended tier according to the following metrics:\n\nLive on Arbitrum for at least 6 months → KyberSwap has been live on Arbitrum for 9+ months\nMeets one of the following criteria:\n$15M Arbitrum Network TVL: KyberSwap Arbitrum TVL is > $17M\n$100M 30D cumulative Volume: KyberSwap Arbitrum 30D volume is > $120M\nGrant Matching: 150,000 KNC\nReasoning: KyberSwap initially received 1,158,932 ARB tokens in the first airdrop. To bootstrap liquidity, we have distributed approximately 1.2M KNC and 450K ARB for liquidity mining incentives to over 20 liquidity pools so far. Additionally, we’ve allocated more KNC to pools with other Arbitrum projects, such as Lido wstETH pools and Axelar axlUSDC, axlETH and axl.wstETH pools. This allocation follows a matching ratio of approximately 75% in KNC and 25% in ARB tokens. Taking into account how much more we allocated in our past and ongoing activities, we anticipate to be able to match a 1.5M ARB STIP grant allocation with up to 150,000 KNC.\n\nGrant Breakdown:\n\nActivity	Percentage	ARB Amount\nLiquidity Mining Incentives	100%	1.5M\nFunding Address:\n\nDAO multisig wallet: 0x91c9d4373b077ef8082f468c7c97f2c499e36f5b\n\nFunding Address Characteristics:\n2/3 multisig: KyberDAO Contract Addresses - KyberSwap Docs 11\n\nContract Addresses:\n\nDistribution Contract Addresses (i.e Farm contracts):\n\nKS Elastic Dynamic: 0x7D5ba536ab244aAA1EA42aB88428847F25E3E676\nKS Elastic Static (for general): 0xf2BcDf38baA52F6b0C1Db5B025DfFf01Ae1d6dBd\nKS Elastic Static (for Frax): 0x3D6AfE2fB73fFEd2E3dD00c501A174554e147a43\nKS Classic: KS Classic farm contracts depend on the pool incentivized. Currently, we do not have any farms planned for KyberSwap Classic, but in case it happens, we will update the contracts in the forum comments.\nIncentivized Contract Addresses (i.e KS Elastic Pools):\n\nThere is a different contract address for each incentivized pool, which is subject to change based on optimization between farm phases; as updating a fee tier means a new pool, and more pools may be added. Please let us know if you need further clarification.\nSECTION 3: GRANT OBJECTIVES AND EXECUTION\nObjectives:\n\nThe primary objective of liquidity incentives is to bootstrap optimized and sustainable liquidity for the most popular pairs and projects on Arbitrum. Simultaneously, we aim to attract a greater number of liquidity provider users to join the Arbitrum ecosystem. This optimized liquidity also plays an important role in enhancing trading volume, given that trading volume scales with TVL. KyberSwap’s liquidity pools are meticulously designed to maximize such volume via capital efficiency, minimized slippage, and competitive rates. Moreover, KyberSwap’s DEX aggregator provides route customization options, enabling further enhancements to trading volume through not only KyberSwap liquidity, but also through all other major DEXs on Arbitrum. Finally, with these incentives, KyberSwap aims to partner with existing Arbitrum projects as well as onboard new projects to Arbitrum.\n\nKey Performance Indicators (KPIs):\n\nTVL: At least ~2x increase in TVL from $17.7M to $35M in 3 months\n\nReasoning: Currently, the TVL on KyberSwap Arbitrum is at around $17.7M with around $200K in monthly incentives. The STIP grant would be around $1.23m (1.5M ARB @ ARB = 0.82), which will help to significantly boost liquidity bootstrapping activities. Spread over 3 months, that’s about ~$410K in monthly incentives. Based on this amount, we expect the TVL to grow about 2.3x to ~$41M. With a buffer to account for changing market conditions, we expect to reach at least $35M in TVL. The extra KNC matching would add another $108k (150K KNC @ KNC = 0.72) for the 4th month, or spread evenly on top of the ARB over 3 months.\n\nVolume: At least ~1.5x increase in 7D volume from $28M to $42M in 3 months\n\nReasoning: Currently, KyberSwap Arbitrum gets about $28M in 7D volume. With the added incentives and creation of new pools, KyberSwap aims to increase this to at least $42M in 7D volume.\n\nLiquidity partnerships: At least 5 liquidity partnerships with other projects over the 3 months from mid October 2023 to mid January 2024.\n\nReasoning: We aim to allocate a portion of the grant to liquidity mining incentives to establish and optimize liquidity for new and existing Arbitrum projects.\n\nHow will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem?\n\nAligned with the goals of the STIP program to incentivize the use of existing dApps on Arbitrum through increased volume, transactions, users, and liquidity, the STIP grant would enable us to build more optimized liquidity in terms of rates and slippage as well as diverse pairs and fee tiers. This would give more incentive for liquidity provider users to come to KyberSwap on Arbitrum, as well as more options for both new and existing liquidity providers. KyberSwap also has a strong record for optimizing liquidity for partner projects, such as Lido wstETH pools and Axelar axlUSDC, axlETH and axl.wstETH pools. Part of this grant will be allocated to even more partner pools. This will not only enable us to further support existing Arbitrum projects to optimize their liquidity, but also to onboard new partners to the Arbitrum ecosystem via KyberSwap.\n\nJustification for the size of the grant:\n\nKyberSwap has been supporting innovation and growth in the blockchain space since the beginning; and has built a liquidity and trading product portfolio dedicated to the best user experience, igniting a supportive community of DeFi projects and users, many of which are on Arbitrum. Since our expansion to Arbitrum, KyberSwap has become an important player in the ecosystem, highlighting our commitment to the growth of the ecosystem and to enhancing trading and liquidity experiences for the Arbitrum community. For example, KyberSwap has integrated about 20 major Arbitrum DEXs into our DEX aggregator, including GMX, Camelot and Uniswap.\n\nSo far, our KyberSwap Elastic AMM has facilitated over $3.07B in volume with over 7,488 unique addresses that provided liquidity and 334,809 unique addresses that traded. To date, we’ve spent 1,197,800 KNC (~$862,416 @ KNC = 0.72) to bootstrap initial liquidity on Arbitrum via liquidity mining, achieving positive results. This would be scaled up with the help of the STIP grant.\n\nFurthermore, we are continuing to establish new partnerships and growth streams for the Arbitrum ecosystem. Not only do our liquidity pools support intra-chain volume, but also inter-chain volume. For example, we’ve incentivized liquidity to support Ethereum to Arbitrum ETH and wstETH bridging/cross-chain swaps together with Axelar, Squid and Lido 1. KyberSwap’s custom fee tiers and minimized slippage played a key role in this enablement. The STIP grant would further enable us to establish even more strong partnerships that can contribute to the ecosystem.\n\nExecution Strategy:\n\nWe plan to allocate and distribute the incentives similar to the following example distribution.\n\nNote: Incentivized pool pairs, fee tiers and allocations subject to change based on optimization between phases. However, the total amount of ARB per month will remain the same at 500K per month over the 3 month period.\n\nCurrent farms ARB distribution	% of total	STIP - Month 1	STIP - Month 2	STIP - Month 3\nUSDT-USDC.e	6,000	5.51%	5.29%	5.07%	4.96%\n—	—	—	—	—	—\nDAI-USDC.e	5,000	4.59%	4.41%	4.22%	4.13%\nWBTC-ETH	8,800	8.08%	7.76%	7.43%	7.27%\nETH-ARB 0.25%	12,800	11.75%	11.28%	10.81%	10.58%\nETH-ARB 1%	5,400	4.96%	4.76%	4.56%	4.46%\nETH-ARB 2%	5,400	4.96%	4.76%	4.56%	4.46%\nETH-ARB 5%	3,000	2.75%	2.64%	2.53%	2.48%\nETH-USDC.e .04%	18,720	17.19%	16.50%	15.81%	15.47%\nETH-USDC.e 2%	2,000	1.84%	1.76%	1.69%	1.65%\nETH-USDT 0.25%	3,200	2.94%	2.82%	2.70%	2.64%\nETH-USDT 1%	2,400	2.20%	2.12%	2.03%	1.98%\nARB-USDC.e	7,000	6.43%	6.17%	5.91%	5.78%\nARB-USDT 2%	7,700	7.07%	6.79%	6.50%	6.36%\nARB-USDT 5%	4,800	4.41%	4.23%	4.05%	3.97%\nARB-KNC	5,400	4.96%	4.76%	4.56%	4.46%\nETH-GMX	2,600	2.39%	2.29%	2.20%	2.15%\nLDO-KNC	2,100	1.93%	1.85%	1.77%	1.74%\nwstETH-KNC	2,800	2.57%	2.47%	2.37%	2.31%\nLINK-KNC	1,800	1.65%	1.59%	1.52%	1.49%\nGRAIL-USDC.e	2,000	1.84%	1.76%	1.69%	1.65%\nNew Partner Pool	n/a	n/a	2%	2%	2%\nNew Partner Pool	n/a	n/a	2%	2%	2%\nNew Partner Pool	n/a	n/a	n/a	2%	2%\nNew Partner Pool	n/a	n/a	n/a	2%	2%\nNew Partner Pool	n/a	n/a	n/a	n/a	2%\nApproach to sustainable liquidity growth\n\nKyberSwap focuses on sustainable liquidity, and as such, optimizes liquidity pools constantly in a way that can maximize both volume and LP fees so that, over time, LP fees can make up an increasing part of total APR. For example, one of the ways to measure the sustainability of a protocol is such LP fees since LP fees are organic APR, vs farm APR from incentives. Currently, KyberSwap generates some of the most LP fees per TVL for liquidity providers. In the past 24h, KyberSwap on Arbitrum has generated $10.32K in fees for LPs with $17.8M in liquidity. Comparatively, Camelot has generated about $10.5K in fees for LPs with $56M in liquidity. And in KyberSwap’s case, a significant portion (over 50%) of the LP fees generated were on ARB-paired pools, incentivizing more LPs to hold and supply ARB.\n\nScreenshot 2023-10-04 at 16.00.29\nScreenshot 2023-10-04 at 16.00.29\n2674×1476 364 KB\n\nScreenshot 2023-10-04 at 15.59.46\nScreenshot 2023-10-04 at 15.59.46\n2674×1476 396 KB\n\nScreenshot 2023-10-04 at 15.59.27\nScreenshot 2023-10-04 at 15.59.27\n2674×1498 429 KB\nAdditionally, another aspect of KyberSwap’s focus on sustainable liquidity via organic volume and LP fees is through custom fee tiers. KyberSwap has particularly high fee tier options such as 2% and 5% for some liquidity pools. While lower fee tier pools support general trading volume, these kinds of fee tiers serve another type of volume which is scalable with price volatility. These high fee tier pools further provide organic APR for liquidity providers while not affecting traders. Together, the lower fee and higher fee tier pools work together to support all types of volume demand, balancing out the interests of liquidity providers for APR and the interests of traders for lower rates.\n\nGrant Timeline:\n\nWe plan to allocate and distribute the ARB from the STIP grant over a period of 3 months (estimated from mid October 2023 to mid January 2024, as per the program requirements). The start and end date are dependent on when the grant is finally received.

Pendle allows anyone to purchase assets at a discount, obtain fixed yield, or long DeFi yield. The protocol enables this by taking yield-bearing tokens and then splitting them into their principal and yield components, PT (principal token) and YT (yield token) respectively, which allows them to be traded via Pendle’s AMM.\n\nTeam Members and Qualifications:\nTN Lee, Co-Founder | previously Head of Business at Kyber Network | Twitter: tn_pendle 13\nVu Nguyen, Co-Founder | previously Tech Lead at Digix | Twitter: gabavineb 15 | GitHub: mrenoon 2\nAnton Buenavista, Ecosystem Lead | previously Senior Software Engineer at Kyber Network | Twitter: ayobuenavista 9 | GitHub: ayobuenavista 2\nKen Chia, Institutional Business Lead | previously Head of APAC at Abra; J.P.

Below is the detailed breakdown:\n\n55% (1,100,000 ARB) will be allocated to the Pendle pools on Arbitrum to deepen liquidity.\n40% (800,000 ARB) will be allocated to campaigns to increase activity and trading volume for the Pendle markets on Arbitrum.\n5% (100,000 ARB) will be allocated to ecosystem integrations that are integrating the Pendle protocol on Arbitrum.\nMore details on the grant usage are under Execution Strategy below.\n\nFunding Address:\n0x7877AdFaDEd756f3248a0EBfe8Ac2E2eF87b75Ac 19\n\nFunding Address Characteristics:\nThe funding address is managed by a 2/4 Safe multisig, where each signer is protected with a HW wallet.\n\nContract Address:\nThe actual funding addresses will be automated incentive distribution contracts, which will then be deployed once the grant is approved. These incentive distribution contracts will be funded and managed by the multisig mentioned above.\n\nSECTION 3: GRANT OBJECTIVES AND EXECUTION\nObjectives:\nOur prime objective is to use the grant to deepen liquidity and increase the trading volume on Pendle, bolster the Arbitrum ecosystem, and highlight the yield-trading use case on Arbitrum moving forward. To date, Pendle has achieved $46M in TVL, $13M average monthly trading volume, and 6k monthly active users on Arbitrum with no extra external incentives. We aim to leverage the Pendle brand to attract new users and capital inflows into Arbitrum.\n\nPendle brings the TradFi interest derivative market into DeFi. In traditional finance, interest rate swaps are the biggest market in the world at >$500T. PT is the equivalent of zero-coupon bonds while YT is the equivalent of coupon payments. Pendle is positioning itself to become a core infrastructure for the next phase of DeFi.\n\nimage\nimage\n1400×515 81.5 KB\nBy creating yield markets on Arbitrum, Pendle helps unlock the full potential of yield. Pendle enables users to execute advanced yield strategies, such as:\n\nLong assets at a discount\nFixed yield for low-risk, stable growth\nLeverage exposure to future yield streams without the need for collateral\nA mix of any of the above strategies\nWe are the only yield-trading protocol, which splits the underlying yield from the principal from a yield-bearing asset, to garner enough traction to put a spotlight on the importance of allowing the market to trade interest rates. Ultimately, Pendle introduces a product necessary for a healthy DeFi ecosystem, and this grant will help accelerate that adoption.\n\nKey Performance Indicators (KPIs):\nKPI	Current Progress on Arbitrum	Milestone by end Nov	Milestone by 31 January 2024\nTVL for Pendle Pools	$46M	$60M	$80M\nAverage Monthly Trading Volume	$13M	$16M	$20M\nMonthly Active Users	5,000 MAU	6500 MAU	8,000 MAU\nHow we measure KPI progress:\nFor TVL and Trading Volume: https://app.sentio.xyz/share/fbe28690s6whiw3h 13\nFor MAU: https://dune.com/queries/3075098/5123957 7\nOther analytics data: https://analytics.pendle.finance 19\n\nHow will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem?:\nWe provide a platform for users to speculate and trade on yield for yield-bearing assets in the Arbitrum ecosystem. When we first launched on Arbitrum, we achieved $10.5 million in trading volume in our first month. In the last 7 months of being live on Arbitrum, we have achieved an average trading volume of $12 million and a growth of $45 million in TVL.\n\nAs we are a second-order derivatives protocol, Pendle works and integrates existing yield-bearing assets, such as GLP, gDAI, Camelot LPs, wstETH, etc., in order to allow users to trade the yield. This allows Pendle to be significantly synergistic with other existing protocols as we rely on DeFi’s principle of composability to enrich the overarching DeFi landscape on Arbitrum. To date, we have listed 12 pools across 8 Arbitrum protocols namely Lido, GMX, Gains Network, RocketPool, Camelot, HMX, Stargate, and Penpie with more incoming as we list more protocol pools.\n\nWe aim to leverage Pendle’s brand and extensive community to further grow of the Arbitrum ecosystem. Therefore, we have some planned collaborations, listings, and product developments in the pipeline which will help further invigorate the yield-trading sector on Arbitrum. As we are the only yield-trading avenue on Arbitrum, we expect users to use and interact with Arbitrum through Pendle even after exhausting the ARB incentives due to the financial opportunities available to trade the yield on Pendle.\n\nJustification for the size of the grant:\nWhile Pendle is known to be the premier yield trading platform on Arbitrum, not many in the Arbitrum ecosystem are familiar with the concept of trading the yield or interest rates. We believe getting a grant from the DAO can help further accelerate our traction there. The size of the requested grant is to ensure the pools on Pendle have a yield that is modestly above the underlying pool’s yield as well as to kickstart additional trading activity through campaigns and quests as described in the earlier sections above. Ultimately, this grant may kickstart a flywheel where users who are initially unfamiliar with the yield trading DeFi primitive would be encouraged to try it out. The expected end result is an increased awareness and usage of yield trading, an overall increase of yield trading volume and TVL, new DeFi use cases via builders building new integrations on top of Pendle, and DeFi strategies that make use of Pendle and other protocols on Arbitrum which further enhances the Arbitrum DeFi ecosystem.\n\nWe believe that our track record, commitment to Arbitrum, and the value that this grant can create for the Arbitrum ecosystem justify the size of the grant requested. To date, over 3.45M PENDLE emissions have been utilized towards Arbitrum. Pendle will continue to support the Arbitrum ecosystem with PENDLE emissions moving forward.\n\nExecution Strategy:\nOur execution strategy is divided into three categories:\n\nPendle Pools\n1,100,000 ARB (55% of the total grant size) will be allocated to the Pendle pools on Arbitrum to deepen liquidity.\nThe allocated grant will be divided across the different pools on Pendle. Specifically, the 1,100,00 ARB will equally be divided across several epochs (an epoch lasts one week starting and ending at Thursday 00:00 UTC) starting from receipt of the grant up until the end of the program on 31st January 2024.\nThere are currently 12 pools across 8 Arbitrum protocols to date and are being incentivized with PENDLE via vePENDLE. Each pool per epoch will receive the allocated grant based on the vePENDLE vote weight the pool has respective to the total voting weight on Arbitrum. This encourages users to vote for the Arbitrum pools across the different networks overall, and therefore a pool’s allocation of ARB incentives may change every epoch.\nAs each pool is essentially an integration with a yield-bearing asset, Pendle will work closely with the Arbitrum partner protocols Lido, GMX, Gains Network, RocketPool, Camelot, HMX, Stargate, and Penpie with more incoming as we list more protocol pools (such as Kyber’s axlwstETH/wstETH Elastic pool) to highlight these incentives.\nPendle Campaigns\n800,000 ARB (40% of the total grant size) will be allocated to campaigns to increase activity and trading volume for the Pendle markets on Arbitrum.\nAt least one campaign per month will be done to keep things fresh and to entice users to keep trying out the campaigns.\nCampaigns may include:\nA seasonal trading campaign that takes advantage of Pendle’s newly released Leaderboard feature, the beta as seen here: https://app.pendle.finance/trade/dashboard/leaderboard/valuation 8. The top transacted volume and net P&L will receive the ARB rewards. This encourages users to explore yield trading and devise strategies to be on top of the leaderboard. Overall, we should expect a growth in volume and user activity from this trading campaign.\nA trading campaign making use of Pendle’s upcoming Limit Order feature. Limit order makers and/or takers will be incentivized with ARB rewards as we expect this to push for more adoption of Pendle’s limit order system, which overall improves liquidity for yield trading and yield trading adoption in the Arbitrum ecosystem in general.\nPendle’s Campaign page, which is a page in our dapp that features task-based quests a user must fulfill in order to earn rewards, as seen here: https://app.pendle.finance/campaigns 7. The team will work on Arbitrum-specific creative campaigns that will fuel excitement on Arbitrum. In addition, Pendle will work with other partner protocols on the campaigns to spur activity across the different DeFi protocols from users. Several campaigns will be planned throughout the duration of October 2023 to the end of January 2024.\nPendle Integrations\n100,000 ARB (5% of the total grant size) will be allocated for users to explore ecosystem integrations that have integrated the Pendle protocol on Arbitrum.\nProtocols that have integrated Pendle on Arbitrum (such as making use of Pendle’s PTs, YTs, or LPs in some way) is a great way to introduce the rest of what the greater DeFi ecosystem has to offer to our community. Users who make further use of their Pendle assets on other Pendle integrations will be able to receive this allocated portion of the grant as additional rewards in order to encourage users to make further use of the Pendle assets that they hold. Users can perform actions such as use PTs as collateral to borrow against in a lending protocol. Not only does this highlight DeFi’s composability across different protocols, but it further encourages users to explore the burgeoning DeFi landscape on Arbitrum. On-chain actions made by users will be tallied on a monthly basis and be rewarded accordingly.\nA distribution contract will be used to facilitate the distribution of the ARB grant across the three categories above.\n\nGrant Timeline:\nThe ARB grant will start being distributed within 7 days of the receipt of the first payment. The program will continue until all ARB is spent up until 31st January 2024. The multisig used at the funding address mentioned above is an operational multisig that can act reasonably quickly. It will work to try to ensure that rewards are claimed and schedules are loaded in sufficient time to prevent any gaps in emissions.\n\nFor each category (as specified above), the following will be the execution timeline:\n\nPendle Pools — 55% of the bi-weekly funding will be loaded on a distribution contract for Pendle pools every epoch.\nPendle Campaigns — 40% of the bi-weekly funding will be saved and then deployed in a distribution contract once a Pendle campaign is live.\nPendle Integrations — 5% of the bi-weekly funding will be loaded into a distribution contract that will disburse rewards monthly based on user activity on Pendle integrated protocols.\nDo you accept the funding of your grant streamed linearly for the duration of your grant proposal, and that the multisig holds the power to halt your stream?\nYes\n\nSECTION 4: PROTOCOL DETAILS\nIs the Protocol Native to Arbitrum?:\nPendle was first deployed on Ethereum. Arbitrum is the second network Pendle deployed on and is the second largest network in terms of TVL and first in terms of monthly average trading volume. Arbitrum has been a key pillar in Pendle’s growth and success.\n\nOn what other networks is the protocol deployed?:\nPendle is deployed on Ethereum, Optimism, BNB Chain, and soon Mantle.\n\nWhat date did you deploy on Arbitrum?:\n1st March 2023\n\nProtocol Performance:\nOur public analytics dashboard: https://analytics.pendle.finance 19\n\n$150M++ TVL ($46M on Arbitrum alone)\n$100M++ TVL just on LSDs alone\n$192M++ total trading volume ($500M if including V1)\n~$1M 24-hour trading volume\n37.9M (~$24M) locked on vePENDLE\n15.8M PENDLE locked on liquid wrappers (Pendle Wars 3)\nLPing into Pendle requires you to interact with the underlying protocol to acquire the yield-bearing asset or position. Our pools are comprised of the underlying against the Principal Token. For example, in the case of the Pendle PT-Stargate-USDT pool, it would be Stargate-USDT/PT-Stargate-USDT. Therefore, when depositing into the Pendle pool using USDT, you’d need to interact with the Stargate USDT to first add liquidity into the Stargate USDT pool and then stake that LP into their farm.\n\nWith the launch of different Pendle pools on Arbitrum, we’ve helped deepen the underlying protocol’s liquidity as Pendle tokenizes either the yield-bearing asset or the yield-bearing position. Over time, we have managed to own a majority of the liquidity from the underlying protocol. Some of the key contributions include:\n\nArbitrum’s rETH pool: 35% liquidity owned, grew liquidity by 57% since launch\nCamelot’s ARB-GRAIL pool: 51% liquidity owned, grew liquidity by 234% since launch\nCamelot’s PENDLE-ETH pool: 70% liquidity owned\nStargate’s USDT Arbitrum pool: 10% liquidity owned\nSource: https://dune.com/pendle/pendle-market-pools-liquidity-dashboard 3\n\nIn terms of unique address and DAU growth over time, we looked at all the transactions that have interacted with our contract and filtered out all the unique wallets. We also use Sentio to calculate these metrics (https://app.sentio.xyz/share/lv18u9fyu1b558xf 1).\n\nPendle V2 Unique Addresses: 55k to date (58k if including unique V1 wallets)\nPendle V2 DAU growth over time:\nProtocol Roadmap:\nOur core focus remains on our yield-trading protocol. Aside from the Arbitrum-specific developments which involve the Pendle Leaderboard and Pendle Campaigns, here is what we expect to accomplish in the next 4 months that works in line with the duration of the program:\n\nLeaderboard official launch\nLaunch of limit orders for yield trading\nLaunch of structured vaults\nAudit History:\nPendle smart contracts have been audited by Ackee, Dedaub, Dingbats, and some of the top wardens from Code4rena. All of Pendle’s smart contracts are open source.\n\nA complete list of audit reports can be found on our GitHub repo:\n\ngithub.com\n1\n//github.com/pendle-finance/pendle-core-v2-public/tree/main/audits\n\nSECTION 5: Data and Reporting\nIs your team prepared to create Dune Dashboards for your incentive program?:\nYes. Aside from Dune, we can create Sentio dashboards in order to present other forms of data as we’ve been using Sentio for our analytics needs.\n\nDoes your team agree to provide bi-weekly program updates on the Arbitrum Forum thread?\nYes, we are committed to updating the Arbitrum Forum thread. We have prepared methods of collecting data and reporting them alongside data dashboards as mentioned above to substantiate our progress. Metrics such as TVL, volume, transactions, and unique addresses will be tracked.\n\nDoes your team acknowledge that failure to comply with any of the above requests can result in the halting of the program’s funding stream?:\nYes",Short Term Incentive Program

The MUX aggregator is currently native to Arbitrum, and has integrated with GMX V1, GMX V2, Gains and MUX native pool on the trading side. MUX aggregator automatically routes traders’ positions (one whole or split positions) to the most suited liquidity source/sources based on market, position size, available liquidity, composite trading cost and user preferences. In addition, MUX also offers various unique features for integrated protocols, like liquidation price optimization, leverage boosting, TP/SL orders, auto-pool selection, aggregated position & display and more, without applying additional costs. The goal is to offer the best possible trading cost and experience and onboard more users to the decentralized trading world.\n\nIn less than 13 months, MUX has generated over $15.2B organic volume for integrated protocols.\n\nIn addition, MUX also has the 3rd highest TVL 27 in the entire on-chain perps sector.\n\nTeam Members and Qualifications:\nJean - growth contributor\ndumbird - growth contributor\n24lu - dev contributor\nmus - dev contributor\nrex - dev contributor\nDC - community contributor\nProject Links:\nDApp 38\nMetabase Dashboard 6\nDune Dashboard 18\nDocs 2\nGithub 2\nTwitter 9\nContact Information\nTG:\n@realdumbird\n@Jeanwdzw\nTwitter:\n@muxprotocol\nEmail:\ndumbird@mux.network\njean@mux.network\nDo You Acknowledge That Your Team Will Be Subject to a KYC Requirement?:\nYes\n\nSECTION 2: GRANT INFORMATION\nRequested Grant Size:\n6,000,000 ARB\n(The original size was 9,000,000 ARB, and after learning community opinions, the requested grant size is lowered by 33%.)\n\nGrant Matching:\nMUX will use the in-house budget to launch multiple promotional campaigns and onboard more users to the ecosystem.\nGrant Breakdown:\nMUX plans to use the grant to onboard more organic users to the Arbitrum ecosystem and increase user engagement, trading volume, TVL and transactions.\n\nTentatively, 55% of the grant will be utilized to reduce trading fees for GMX V1, GMX V2, Gains, and MUX native pool positions opened through the MUX aggregator.\n\nPlease note, for the proposed rebates, the rebate rate will be based on the users’ actual fees spent; if the integrated protocols also offer additional rebates/rewards separately, MUX will ensure the final total rebates won’t exceed the fees paid. There will be no trade-to-earn opportunities during this campaign. In addition, MUX contributors will closely monitor and prevent wash trading and Sybil-attack-related activities from this campaign to ensure proper grant usage; addresses involving wash trading or Sybil-attack-related activities will be published and excluded from receiving the rebates.\n\nFee rebates\nARB tokens will be distributed as fee rebates to traders weekly on Thursdays UTC based on the fees they spend during the week.\nThe fee reduction will be applied to all integrated protocols without discrimination.\nThis covers all markets offered by GMX V1, GMX V2, Gains and MUX native pool.\nThe rebates that traders can receive won’t exceed the fees they spend on trading. There will be no room for trade-to-earn activities.\nThe rebate rate will be based on the users’ actual fees spent; if the integrated protocols also offer additional rebates separately, MUX will ensure the final total rebates won’t exceed the fees paid.\nThe grant spending pacing will depend on organic trading activities during each week.\nMUX contributors will closely monitor and prevent wash trading and Sybil-attack-related activities from this campaign.\nAddresses involving wash trading or Sybil-attack-related activities will be published and excluded from receiving the rebates. MUX contributors reserve the right to identify any Sybil-attack-related addresses and exclude them from the incentive program.\nThe anti-wash-trading & anti-Sybil-attack rules will remain unrevealed. Otherwise, the rules can be abused with planned strategies. Just like before a network or protocol launches the airdrop, they announce the Anti-Sybil rules afterward instead of beforehand. This is intentional to ensure the proper grant usage with no wash-trading or Sybil attacks.\nIntegrated protocol trading fee rates before and after reduction\nGMX V1: 0.1% → 0%\nGMX V2: 0.05% / 0.07% → 0%\nGains: Crypto 0.08% → 0%; Forex 0.012% / 0.016% / 0.02% → 0%; Commodities 0.05% / 0.08% → 0%\nMUX Native Pool: 0.06% → 0%\nIf more perps trading protocols in the Arbitrum ecosystem are integrated into MUX during the campaign, the fee deduction will be applied to them as well.\nTrading competitions & other forms of promotional trading events\nAside from the trading fee rebates, MUX can potentially launch promotional trading events, not limited to trading competitions, based on market sediments and volatility.\nThe objective is to boost user adoption and trading demand, referencing organic market trends.\nTentatively, 45% of the grant will be utilized to increase yield for the MUX native pools on Arbitrum.\n\nContext\nThe MUX native pool currently has the 3rd highest TVL 27 in the on-chain perps trading sector. Over 80% of the MUX native pool TVL is on Arbitrum.\nIn addition, the aggregator has also integrated with the GLP pool, GM pools and gDAI vault to offer the currently deepest aggregated liquidity in the on-chain perps sector for traders.\nHowever, when trading demand surges, the open interest caps can still be reached across all integrated protocols, limiting traders to opening more needed positions.\nMUXLP stakers currently earn #RealYield in the form of $ETH tokens weekly from protocol income. By offering additional $ARB token incentives for LPs, the pool size can increase to support more trading demand and initiate a flywheel effect with the trading incentives.\nThe grant allocation ratio for trading and liquidity incentives is tentative and can be adjusted based on performance.\n\nIf the trading demand and trading fees surge more than expected, more incentives will be allocated toward the trading side to ensure 0% trading fees for all integrated protocols.\nIf the liquidity cannot support enough trading demand and guarantee optimized trading experiences, more incentives will be allocated toward the liquidity side.\nThe incentive mechanism can be adjusted accordingly to ensure the most efficient usage and results for accelerating user adoption.\nFunding Address:\n0x4Fa610DD115e790B8768A482Fc366803534e9Adc\n\nFunding Address Characteristics:\n2/3 multisig\n\nContract Address:\n0xe21d366d5042F713C0C872591e610fB6a74C775b\n\nSECTION 3: GRANT OBJECTIVES AND EXECUTION\nObjectives:\nAccelerate user adoption for the Arbitrum ecosystem.\nIncrease organic transactions and sequencer fees for Arbitrum.\nIncrease trading volume & protocol income for all integrated protocols, and further onboard more LPs to all integrated liquidity sources and the Arbitrum ecosystem.\nStrengthen the Arbitrum ecosystem as the on-chain derivatives trading hub.\nKey Performance Indicators (KPIs):\nTrading Volume\nDaily Active Users(DAU)\nTVL(Product and Protocol side)\nSequencer fees\nHow will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem?:\nMUX has integrated with three leading perps protocols regarding TVL and organic trading volume in the Arbitrum ecosystem: GMX (V1 & V2), Gains and MUX native pool. Users can freely choose preferred protocols for opening needed positions, or the aggregator can automatically select the most suited liquidity source based on market, available liquidity, and trading cost. As a result, MUX has onboarded a community of web3 native traders to Arbitrum and contributed a notable amount of organic volume to integrated protocols in the ecosystem.\n\nCurrently, DEX to CEX futures trading volume is between 1% - 2% daily 1 The trading cost is the one key factor constraining trader acquisition for perpetual DEXes, as the typical fee rate range on CEXes is 0.02% - 0.05%, while the standard fee rate range on DEXes is 0.05% - 0.1%. As the trading experiences and features on perp DEXes advance, the higher trading cost is still a barrier for more traders to onboard.\n\nArbitrum is the epicenter of perp DEX innovations; 5 of the top 6 perp dexes in TVL 27 are currently deployed on Arbitrum. If the trading cost barrier can be crossed for a decent amount of time, the Arbitrum ecosystem can accelerate user adoption and onboard more traders from other web3 and web2 ecosystems.\n\nIn addition, a notable number of yield farming protocols have integrated with GLP, GM, gDAI and MUXLP. Boosting trading volume for the integrated protocols on the MUX aggregator will help increase the yield for related pools and can potentially onboard more LPs.\n\nThe MUX native pool currently has the 3rd highest TVL 27 in the on-chain perps trading sector. Over 80% of the MUX native pool TVL is on Arbitrum. In addition, the aggregator has also integrated with the GLP pool, GM pools and gDAI vault to offer the currently deepest aggregated liquidity in the on-chain perps sector for traders. However, when trading demand surges, the open interest caps can still be reached across all integrated protocols, limiting traders to opening more needed positions. By offering additional $ARB token incentives for LPs, the pool size can increase to support more trading demand and initiate a flywheel effect with the trading incentives.\n\nJustification for the size of the grant:\nThe campaign duration is estimated to be 4 months.\n\nFor the trading incentive: MUX plans to use the grant to directly rebate trading fees for traders, the contributors estimated the grant size based on the organic trading fees that the MUX aggregator generated for all integrated protocols in the past 4 months.\n\nBetween June 21 and September 21, the total organic trading volume on MUX was $5.63B, and the trading fees generated for integrated protocols were over $4M. The volume and income were generated without offering any forms of trading incentives, proving MUX aggregator’s proper product-market-fit and organic user base. If the fees can be further lowered through rebates, we can reasonably expect the aggregator to onboard more traders from other ecosystems. MUX contributors used the metrics as a reference and wished to reduce the trading fees with the grant to accelerate trader adoption.\n\nRegarding liquidity incentives, the MUX native pool currently offers a significant portion of protocol income through $ETH tokens and additional $MUX token incentives for LPs. The APR has been between 15% - 50% in the past four months. The MUX native pool TVL reached over $60M at its peak because of the high yield. Through offering additional $ARB token incentives for LPs, the pool size can increase to support more trading demand and initiate a flywheel effect with the trading incentives.\n\nExecution Strategy:\nMUX contributors will add a trading fee rebate distribution setup to the Dapp.\nAll trading fees that traders spend on any integrated protocols (currently GMX V1, GMX V2, Gains and MUX native pool) during the campaign will be tracked.\nMUX aggregator will distribute trade fee rebates to traders weekly on Thursdays in the form of $ARB tokens.\nUpon distribution, the number of ARB tokens rebated is calculated based on traders’ weekly trading fees and the real-time ARB token price.\nMUX contributors will closely monitor and prevent wash trading and Sybil-attack-related activities from this campaign and ensure the proper usage of funds.\nAddresses involving wash trading or Sybil-attack-related activities will be published and excluded from receiving the rebates.\nDistributed rebates will be entirely based on the organic trading fees that traders spent during the week.\nThe grant spending pacing will depend on organic trading activities during each week.\nIf all approved grants are spent before January 31, 2023, the campaign will end early.\nIf the approved grants are not fully spent before January 31, 2023, the remaining grant will be returned to the Arbitrum DAO.\nIf MUX does launch additional promotional trading events during the campaign, MUX dev contributors will develop needed setups for the events.\nFor liquidity incentives, $ARB incentives will be added to the rewards composition.\nMUX contributors will launch multiple marketing campaigns using the in-house marketing budget to promote this campaign and accelerate trader adoption for the Arbitrum ecosystem.\nGrant Timeline:\nOctober 14th, 2023 - January 31, 2024\n\nDo you accept the funding of your grant streamed linearly for the duration of your grant proposal, and that the multisig holds the power to halt your stream?\nYes\n\nSECTION 4: PROTOCOL DETAILS\nIs the Protocol Native to Arbitrum?:\nThe MUX aggregator is native to Arbitrum and has only integrated with protocols on Arbitrum.\n\nThe MUX native pool is multi-chain native, while 80% + of the TVL is on Arbitrum and leveraging Arbitrum as the base chain to handle all staking activities.\n\nOn what other networks is the protocol deployed?:\nMUX Aggregator\n\nNone\nMUXLP Pool\n\nAvalanche\nBNB Chain\nOptimism\nFantom\nWhat date did you deploy on Arbitrum?:\nAug. 1st, 2022\n\nProtocol Performance:\nBy September 21, 2023, the following MUX metrics are\n\nCumulative trading volume on Arbitrum: $14,290,826,513\nArbitrum TVL: $41,161,410\nHistorical total users: 18,014\nArbitrum transactions: 671,693\n\nReferences: Dune Dashboard 18, Metabase Dashboard 6\n\nProtocol Roadmap:\nQ3 & Q4 2023\n\nLaunch a new trading setup to support more markets\nLaunch a new liquidity setup to support long-tail markets\nLaunch a new MUXLP liquidity setup to meet diverse risk exposure preferences\nAllow collateral token swap\nAllow updating placed orders\nLong Term\n\nAggregate more innovative perps trading protocols\nContinuously onboarding organic traders\nFurther lowering trading costs for traders\nAudit History:\nMUX leveraged trading protocol contracts audit 1\nMUX leveraged trading aggregator contracts audit\nSECTION 5: Data and Reporting\nIs your team prepared to create Dune Dashboards for your incentive program?:\nYes, MUX contributors will create a Dune dashboard to track the grant usage and all KPI metrics.\n\nDoes your team agree to provide bi-weekly program updates on the Arbitrum Forum thread?\nYes, MUX contributors will provide bi-weekly program updates along with needed metrics on the Arbitrum Forum thread.\n\nDoes your team acknowledge that failure to comply with any of the above requests can result in the halting of the program’s funding stream?:\nYes",Short Term Incentive Program

Moreover, it's difficult to fully understand the technical demands and design structures that can adapt to changing needs of decentralized applications, let alone addressing real-world gaps with novel web3 use cases. This is because many smart contracts are built in monolithic contracts that lack composability, which makes it much more costly and time-consuming to build new smart contracts or change the existing ones. Many projects that try to realize a product market through multiple iterations are burdened by these recurrently aggravating expenses, in some cases leading to the failure of the project.\n\nWhile wealthy projects have the means to create, update, and audit complex smart contracts, not every project enjoys such financial luxury. The blockchain ecosystem needs a communication protocol that simplifies the creation of blockchain apps and allows for continuous innovation without pouring massive resources into smart contract development. Without this, scaling the transformative powers of blockchain to real-world adaption and novel use cases is extremely challenging.\n\n​​\n\nProject Overview\n\nIn today's world, 152 out of 195 countries are regarded as developing countries, where in many of them, the average monthly salary is less than $500.\n\nhttps://www.worlddata.info/average-income.php\n\nWith a vision to lower entry barriers, Inverter Protocol aims to democratize building on blockchain by addressing the longstanding challenges in blockchain application development, namely high costs, intricate technical demands, and the rigid, non-composable design seen in many monolithic smart contracts.\n\nInverter addresses these challenges with a modular framework designed for on-chain operating systems. Its design allows for configuring and operating protocols as smart contract workflows, ensuring they are both upgradable and extendable. To achieve this, we break down smart contract functionalities into compatible modules. This method allows for individualized adjustments, fine-tuning smart contract capabilities to serve unique needs while maintaining overall coherence. Think of these modules as specialized tools: developers can use these building blocks to craft personalized smart contract workflows and set the groundwork for a wide range of use cases.\n\nWhile Inverter is designed for broad compatibility across multiple chains, its core values and features are especially synergistic with Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum. This alignment prioritizes enhanced scalability and reduced on-chain burden, making it particularly advantageous for builders on Arbitrum.\n\nLearn more about Inverter Architecture:\n\nhttps://github.com/InverterNetwork/InverterProtocolArchitecture\n\nUse Cases\n\nLearn more about how Bloom Network is scaling its impact based funding programs with Inverter:\n\nhttps://www.inverter.network/post/bloom-x-inverter-building-a-regenerative-action-bounty-system-for-local-communities\n\nLearn more about oStake, a novel oracle-based staking contract build with Inverter’s modular framework:\n\nhttps://docsend.com/view/s4g3hhpvfqs6bqaq\n\nCore Offerings\n\nInverter Open Library of Modules:\n\nThis is a robust collection of reusable, upgradable, and audited standalone smart contracts. These modules are designed with broad blockchain compatibility in mind and can be customized and composed into protocols and mechanisms to serve their unique needs. When integrated with platforms like Arbitrum, our architecture can further expedite protocol and application development and collaboration across the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nOrchestrator Contract:\n\nOur core operator contracts act as an interoperability layer that connects Inverter modules, ensuring seamless asset flows, permissions, and logic functionalities. Its unique design offers users a low-code interface to configure and dynamically operate smart contracts.\n\nWith Inverter’s architecture, projects on Arbitrum can immediately adapt and modify functionalities without additional development and auditing costs.\n\nStartup toolkit SDKs:\n\nThe Inverter Protocol introduces a sophisticated suite of workflow templates that can function as SDKs, catering specifically to startups and emergent enterprises in search of robust, cost-efficient blockchain solutions. Each component within Inverter's offering undergoes rigorous auditing, ensuring security and efficacy right out of the box.\n\nFurthermore, we are designing our intuitive drag-and-drop interface to democratize the creation process. This means that even individuals with nascent blockchain expertise will be able to conceptualize, design, and implement intricate workflows, thus accelerating the pathway from ideation to real-world application.\n\nVision\n\nOur long-term vision is to establish Inverter as a standard in blockchain protocols, offering a durable framework that allows organizations to easily set up and manage smart contracts tailored for their needs. Our Open Library of Modules, maintained by the community, will serve as the foundation for our interoperable solutions. To realize this vision, we're developing the Inverter Control Room, an interactive low-code interface, where users can effortlessly select, simulate, and deploy modules to design workflows. When paired with Arbitrum's cost-effective ecosystem, it presents a unique opportunity for developers previously deterred by the steep costs of blockchain development. Additionally, as projects adopt Inverter—whether on Arbitrum or not—their additions to the Open Library of Modules enrich the entire community. This creates a cohesive ecosystem where developers benefit from each other’s innovation and thrive together.\n\nAdditional Information\nFunding Sources\n\nAngels, grants and bootstrapping\n\nTeam Size\n\n10",Plurality Labs - Gitcoin Round

Community Trust & Reputation: A less tangible but crucial metric is the trust and reputation I hold within the community. This can be gauged through direct feedback, conversations, or general sentiment in community discussions.\n\n3.	Ecosystem Stability & Growth: Lastly, the overall growth and stability of the Arbitrum ecosystem during my tenure also serves as a barometer of the quality and success of my stewardship. It's not easily attributable to one particular delegate, but my contribution towards it is a significant indicator of my impact.\nHas this work been previously funded? If so, by who and for how much?

This website plays a key role in promoting good governance by enhancing transparency in the delegation process.\n\nVoting Power on this website makes the connections between delegates and their delegators easily accessible and understandable. This clarity is vital in discerning which delegates are influenced by specific wallets, fostering a more transparent governance system.\n\nMoreover, the website includes a useful tool for analyzing the distribution of an individual's voting power. It sheds light on whether their influence is evenly spread or concentrated in the hands of a single major wallet.
